<div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p>There are certain instances in my childhood that stand out above the rest. A good number of these involve some sort of video game, with my face glued to a screen. One of the earliest games I could remember was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_VI" target="_blank">King&#x2019;s Quest VI</a>, a choose your own adventure game that ran on probably the first computer I ever touched. A few years later, I remember heading to the Toys &#x2018;R&#x2019; Us in Sheepshead Bay, where I would make arguably one of the biggest decision a kid in Brooklyn could make in the mid-1990&#x2019;s&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue" target="_blank">Red version or Blue</a>.</p><figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><img data-image-id="1*_MdfIi7rGx6Yz8rqXvcbKQ.jpeg" data-width="568" data-height="320" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*_MdfIi7rGx6Yz8rqXvcbKQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">decisions&#x2026; decisions&#x2026;</figcaption></figure><p>Fast forward to 2017.</p><p>For the majority of my coding journey, I&#x2019;ve tinkered with mostly JavaScript-related stuff. Node has been my backend of choice and React has been my favorite library. But when there&#x2019;s so much excitement about a little thing called Python, that is knowledge I couldn&#x2019;t ignore.</p><h3>The Python Experiment</h3><figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><img data-image-id="1*sSOBM-3-jB1oTa3oouDu_g.gif" data-width="480" data-height="211" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*sSOBM-3-jB1oTa3oouDu_g.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">It&#x2019;s not all bad, Dr.&#xA0;Jones</figcaption></figure><p>To be honest, my interest in Python came more from machine learning and data scraping. Beautiful Soup is fantastic, and the ease of the language makes it so much more attractive to use on a backend, despite having more experience in Node.</p><p>But while Python has all these more practical features, there will always be room for a short project that tugs at my nostalgia. So I took a couple days to try and make a console application.</p><p><a href="http://introtopython.org/terminal_apps.html#Why-write-terminal-apps?" target="_blank">Why a console application</a>? The terminal is an oft disregarded program that&#x2019;s use is either for working with Git (for developers) or for completely ignoring in case you cause your computer to blow up (for the non-techies). Becoming comfortable with the console is what all programmers to strive for, and the lack of a true GUI allows the creator to focus solely on what his or her code is doing, and not how it looks on a particular browser.</p><p>As I scoured the Internet for more examples of what other developers have done in the console, I saw plenty of fantasy-driven storylines, where the hero grabs a sword at some point and fights a dragon. This is all well and good. My original idea was to do something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda</a>-related. This sort of adventure seemed to fit the bill of a choose your own adventure game. However, the memory of that Toys &#x2018;R&#x2019; Us trip in &#x2019;97 kept coming back to me.</p><figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><img data-image-id="1*bxKSoBhbfQW23ora1DaaEw.png" data-width="380" data-height="350" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*bxKSoBhbfQW23ora1DaaEw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">such top-notch graphics right&#xA0;there</figcaption></figure><p>Making decisions is at the heart of the Pok&#xE9;mon formula. While Link deals with adding inventory and fighting enemies, the basis of Pok&#xE9;mon falls on which creature you&#x2019;ll start with, and how this decision will impact your future as a trainer.</p><p>The overall code runs pretty simply. The main() function runs in the bottom of the code, then calls the functions that above it. Each decision is a function that features a future function at the bottom of it. At the moment, it is not the most complicated decision tree, but it manages to currently have over a half-dozen outcomes depending on your choices. The code runs in the terminal with the use of a virtual environment, something that I was unfamiliar with, coming from the JavaScript world.</p><figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><img data-image-id="1*I51KEPyZyOm0AyqOSadG0A.gif" data-width="480" data-height="366" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*I51KEPyZyOm0AyqOSadG0A.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">my start&#xA0;screen</figcaption></figure><p>I had a blast creating this mini-application, but it is, overall, a simple game. There are no classes&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;this would make a more intricate battle system with hit points and whatnot. Neither am I using <a href="https://pythontips.com/2013/08/02/what-is-pickle-in-python/" target="_blank">Pickle</a> to save progress. The game is currently short enough to finish in one setting. While I could continue with the storyline, travel to gyms, and obtain badges, this would best be served in a future application, where I would create my own characters, implement a true battle system, and make use of the creative writing minor I received while at undergrad.</p><p>As a lifelong learner and frequent teacher, I will say that creating a fun application like this serves the purpose of teaching without a struggle. More challenging concepts came more naturally because I was having fun. What&#x2019;s more&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;seeing the beauty of what Python can create gave me a greater appreciation for JavaScript, a language I&#x2019;ve played around with all too well, yet never understood how strange it could be when compared with other languages. I even had the pleasure of adding an Easter egg that allows the user to obtain Pikachu as his starting Pok&#xE9;mon. Not bad for a silly console, application, huh?</p><figure><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><img data-image-id="1*QtgyiFepJTh9TBjwTsKarg.gif" data-width="480" data-height="239" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*QtgyiFepJTh9TBjwTsKarg.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">to be honest, I was more of a Charmander-guy growing&#xA0;up</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Thanks for reading.
