<img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/t9v3zx4.png">                    <div class="paragraph">Before starting a new coding task, I find it&#x2019;s usually worthwhile to spend at least a little time trying to find a related working example, especially when the task touches on unfamiliar libraries or concepts. </div><blockquote>If I can find a good example, skimming it shifts my brain in the right direction and it feels like I&#x2019;m absorbing some of its lessons. </blockquote><div class="paragraph">My project is more likely to go smoothly, even if I don&#x2019;t use a single line of code from the example.</div><div class="paragraph">Finding that good example, however, isn&#x2019;t always so easy and the search itself might waste a lot of time. This article offers tips on how to quickly find nice code samples.&#xA0;</div><h2>The Treasure Hunt Takes Too&#xA0;Long</h2><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-th230hz" alt></div><div class="paragraph">Usually my hope is to find a repository that uses the library or context I&#x2019;m researching, some repo that&#x2019;s generally well written and isn&#x2019;t too huge or overwhelming.</div><div class="paragraph">I&#x2019;ve found that search engines, even ones dedicated to code search, are mostly frustrating and unproductive. </div><blockquote>Simple searches using reasonable keywords rarely work, persisting leads to madness. </blockquote><div class="paragraph"></div><h2>Search Engine&#xA0;Filters</h2><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-mp8h302j" alt></div><div class="paragraph">For our sideways search, we&#x2019;ll use advanced search operators, mostly the <pre><code>inurl:</code></pre> and <pre><code>site:</code></pre> Google filters. Some other ones can be handy too, here&apos;s a nice reference: <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html">search filter cheat sheet</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">Bing offers <a href="http://help.bing.microsoft.com/#apex/18/en-us/10001/0">similar ones</a> but not a URL filter. If you prefer Bing, their <pre><code>intitle:</code></pre> filter should usually be an ok substitute for <em>inurl</em>.</div><blockquote>We&#x2019;ll use these advanced filters to search non-code files, ones that are properly indexed by the search engine even when the code next to it is not.</blockquote><div class="paragraph">With <em>inurl</em>, we can filter to specific text files like Dockerfiles or READMEs or, powerfully, dependency manifest files like Node&#x2019;s <em>package.json</em>, Python&#x2019;s <em>requirements.txt</em>, Ruby&#x2019;s <em>Gemfile</em>, etc.&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph">Some sites explicitly offer dependency graph search as a feature (including package managers and GitHub) but I find that Google&#x2019;s page rank voodoo beats these.&#xA0;</div><h2>Example Of a Successful Search</h2><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-c3g730jt" alt></div><div class="paragraph">Let&#x2019;s say my current task is roughing out a testing framework for an <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> project.</div><div class="paragraph">I might start my hunt with: <pre><code>inurl:package.json &quot;electron&quot; &quot;mocha&quot;</code></pre>. (If you&apos;re not familiar with Node, <em>mocha</em> is a popular testing framework.) The <em>inurl</em> filter restricts results to pages with <em>package.json</em> in the URL.</div><div class="paragraph">I&#x2019;ll start opening tabs that look promising, swapping search terms now and then, maybe replacing &#x201C;mocha&#x201D; with &#x201C;jest&#x201D; (another test framework) then trying again with a <em>site</em> filter to limit results to GitHub (with <pre><code>site:github.com</code></pre>) then GitLab. </div><div class="paragraph">Want your example in TypeScript? Add a <pre><code>&quot;@types&quot;</code></pre> or <pre><code>&quot;tsc&quot;</code></pre> search term.</div><div class="paragraph">In a couple minutes, we find <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flipper">Facebook Flipper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat">Rocket.Chat</a>, repositories that are popular, up-to-date, and well-maintained. They&#x2019;re also huge and overwhelming. I&#x2019;m sure there are great lessons to learn within, but we&#x2019;re in a hurry. Our search also turns up some small, wholesome repositories, ones that are easier to skim like: <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-serve">sindresorhus/electron-serve</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/alexanderwe/checksum-validator">checksum-validator</a>.</div><blockquote>I won&#x2019;t say we struck gold, but evaluating these working examples offers a big productivity boost and we found them in just a few minutes. </blockquote><div class="paragraph">One of the smaller projects shows us how to use <em>spectron</em> for headless testing, the other helps us consider using smoke tests. (Personally, the exercise helped me also decide to move all direct calls to Electron out of the User Interface via <a href="https://github.com/wranggle/rpc">@wranggle/rpc</a>, making the exercise extra-worthwhile.)</div><h2>Local Collections</h2><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-pwof30n3" alt></div><div class="paragraph">Let&#x2019;s say we&#x2019;re new to Django and want to see some real world examples of it making <em>GROUP BY</em> database queries.</div><div class="paragraph">Some potential search keywords pop out when skimming the official documentation on <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/aggregation/">db aggregation</a>. We might try GitHub&#x2019;s <em>Code</em> search tab on some, (<em>Login required; submit search then click &#x201C;Code&#x201D; tab</em>) but I&#x2019;ve had mostly bad luck with it. </div><div class="paragraph">We might try a Google search on <pre><code>&quot;from django.db.models import Q&quot; filetype:py</code></pre> and that would turn up some examples, but there&apos;s a better way.</div><div class="paragraph">Instead of searching directly for uses of our aggregation query, let&#x2019;s build up a locally-saved collection of nice, well-written example projects and search that.</div><div class="paragraph">You may have seen <a href="https://github.com/topics">GitHub Topics</a>, but did you know you can search for topics too? Submit a <a href="https://github.com/search">search</a>, then click on the &#x201C;Topic&#x201D; tab. These are self-tagged by the repository owner but it&#x2019;s still a great way to find sample repositories.</div><blockquote>There&#x2019;s likely a nice CRM, CMS, blog, and e-commerce app in most any language. (Plus maybe even a ToDo list!)&#xA0;</blockquote><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-97v430pq" alt></div><div class="paragraph">GitHub&#x2019;s Topic and Repository tabs help us find polished, popular, and well-maintained projects that we can add to our local collection.</div><blockquote>I suggest saving a local copy of all that look good. You can then search them using your own IDE far more effectively than any online tool I&#x2019;ve ever tried. </blockquote><div class="paragraph">You&#x2019;ll have far better results than using GitHub&#x2019;s in-repository search and will be able to revisit these same examples in the future.</div><div class="paragraph">Sure enough, this approach reveals plenty usage examples for that aggregation query, and better yet, we can evaluate how they&#x2019;re testing them.</div><h2>Human And Awesome Human&#xA0;Content</h2><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-gbz330j7" alt></div><div class="paragraph">When investigating some coding problem, regular searches turn up articles/tutorials, answers on StackOverflow/Gitter, discussions on HackerNews/Reddit, etc. </div><div class="paragraph">From the perspective of finding a pre-task primer, you know best if one of these would be more helpful than sample code. </div><blockquote>Regardless, high quality resources of either type can often be found in a curated list, and the easiest to find are the <em>awesome lists</em>.</blockquote><div class="paragraph">When I yet again forget the CSS syntax for flexbox items, a plain search always takes me to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">css-tricks</a>, and it&#x2019;s nice enough. But if I take a bit more time to find an awesome list from <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome.re</a> or by searching on <pre><code>awesome flexbox</code></pre>, I&apos;ll find a <a href="https://jonibologna.com/blog/flexbox-cheatsheet">great resource</a>.</div><h2>Code Search&#xA0;Sites</h2><div class="paragraph">If you want to search for a specific code blurb, <a href="https://searchcode.com/">searchcode.com</a> might be worth a try. Of the direct code search tools, it seems to be the best when you don&#x2019;t already have a list of known repositories. </div><div class="paragraph">For that aggregation query, a search on <pre><code>&quot;from django.db.models import Q&quot;</code></pre> seems to return decent results.</div><div class="paragraph">The same search using GitHub&#x2019;s code-search feature produces far worse results. Hopefully GitHub/Microsoft will continue to invest in code search. (I would love for them to add an &#x201C;exact match&#x201D; feature, and a feature that does a deep code search in each repository I follow or have starred.)</div><div class="paragraph"><a href="https://sourcegraph.com/search">SourceGraph</a>, a commercial code-search tool, might be worth a look for teams that want to share and search their own curated list of repositories. You need to know which repositories you want to index ahead of time though. (I&#x2019;ve never tried it but that feature sounds useful.)&#xA0;</div><h2>Noticing When it&#x2019;s a Waste Of&#xA0;Time</h2><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-lu1cu309s" alt></div><div class="paragraph">Let&#x2019;s take a look at a rougher search process. Say our next task is to add <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Webpack code splitting</a> to a different project. We haven&#x2019;t yet started and we&#x2019;re not (yet?) stuck, we&#x2019;re just following the good general practice of doing our initial research.&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph">A search on <pre><code>&quot;splitChunks&quot; inurl:webpack.config.js</code></pre> fails, returning very few results. Changing <em>inurl</em> to <pre><code>intitle:webpack.config</code></pre> returns slightly more but a lot of it is noise. We find some examples but spend a lot of time sifting.</div><div class="paragraph">We can&#x2019;t do a dependency search as we did for our Electron task because <em>splitChunks</em> is part of WebPack core, it doesn&#x2019;t add a dependency. Scooting further sideways with a dependency search on something else in the general neighborhood (<em>mini-css-extract-plugin</em>) produces decent results but getting to that keyword required unnecessary research.</div><div class="paragraph">Searching for a Gist (<pre><code>&quot;splitChunks&quot; site:gist.github.com</code></pre>) also leads us to good example uses, but not to a full example repository. (I don&apos;t know why Gist is indexed but the master repository is not. <a href="https://github.com/robots.txt">Robots.txt</a> permits both.)</div><div class="paragraph">Overall, in this case, using human-curated resources would have been a better use of time. Or I should have stopped the search early, to possibly pick it up again after attempting the task myself.</div><h2>When To&#xA0;Stop?</h2><div class="paragraph">Searching for sample code can be an open-ended exercise. It&#x2019;s really easy to spend unproductive hours searching for and reading samples. </div><blockquote>Keep in mind that finding or understanding a given sample isn&#x2019;t the goal, you have your own coding project to finish. </blockquote><div class="paragraph">That stubborn drive to finish what you&#x2019;ve started is usually a positive force, but if finding a sample isn&#x2019;t vital and you&#x2019;re not turning up anything useful, it&#x2019;s better to move on.</div><div class="paragraph">Otherwise, maybe set a time range for the exercise. If you&#x2019;re unfamiliar with the current topic, give it a relatively higher upper bound. If you hit the limit but the exercise still feels productive, adjust it upwards. </div><div class="paragraph">In contrast, move on early if the samples aren&#x2019;t useful or if you just feel ready to start your own task. The best sign that the exercise was a success is if you&#x2019;re getting ideas on how to do things better than the sample.</div><div class="paragraph">On the lower time bound, consider spending some minimum time looking at sample code before starting a new task. Reading code is way less fun than writing it but there&#x2019;s a lot to learn in other people&#x2019;s repositories, even if you already know how to accomplish your task.</div><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/gJs0F5rEFHY3N054l1kzkUTIIi13-6z1ea30v5" alt></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">If you have any other ideas or techniques for finding sample code, please pass them along!</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><em>Photo credits in order of appearance:</em></div><ol><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Xbje8u5Yu2U">Elijah O&apos;Donnell</a></li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/treasure-map-navigation-map-1850653/">Pexels</a></li><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/sDf_4tn3ImE">Milada Vigerova</a></li><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/bH7kZ0yazB0">Ian Stauffer</a></li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/users/Pexels-2286921/">Pexels</a></li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/checklist-check-list-marker-2077020/">TeroVesalainen</a></li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/blue-sunglasses-woman-swimming-pool-2705642/">Daniel Sampaio</a></li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/hourglass-time-verinnen-clock-sand-1020126/">3D_Maennchen</a></li><li><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/red-stop-sign-road-road-sign-1315030/">Prawny</a><br></li></ol><div class="paragraph"></div>                    <h2 class="tags-header">Tags</h2>          <div class="archive-tags">                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/code-search">Code Search</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/productivity-hacks">Productivity Hacks</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/example-code">Example Code</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/productivity">Productivity</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/coding">Coding</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/engineering-management">Engineering Management</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/reading-source-code">Reading Source Code</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/latest-tech-stories">Latest Tech Stories</a>                      </div>                                        <div class="twitter-discussion">            <a target="_blank" href="https://community.hackernoon.com/t/16066">Continue the Discussion <i class="fas fa-comments-alt"></i></a>          </div>
