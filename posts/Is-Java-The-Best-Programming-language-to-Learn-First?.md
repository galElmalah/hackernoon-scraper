<img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/b216f3z7z.png">                    <div class="paragraph">I often receive questions like <em>which is a first programming language to learn?</em> <em>Is Java a good programming language to start with?</em>,  <em>how good Java is as a first programming language?</em> <em>which is the best programming language for beginners, </em>or <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/11/java-vs-python-which-programming-laungage-to-learn-first.html">shall I start with Java or Python?</a>. </div><div class="paragraph">Well, the answer to all these questions is, Java is one of the most popular programming languages, and there are a lot of <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/07/10-reasons-to-learn-java-programming.html">reasons to learn Java</a>, starting with Job opportunities to leveraging community support. </div><div class="paragraph">But, in the context of beginning programming or choosing Java as the first language, my most significant reason is that <em>it&apos;s simpler to learn</em>. </div><div class="paragraph">People may argue that <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018-best-of-lot-26644a99e7ec">Python</a> is even simpler and doesn&apos;t even require to compile but I personally found Java much easier to read and understand.</div><div class="paragraph">The last generation of programmers started learning to program using languages like BASIC and then grew up learning C and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-c-courses-to-learn-programming-in-2019-d27352277da0">C++</a> with <a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/07/is-java-best-programming-language-for-beginners.html">Java</a> as their second or third programming language.</div><div class="paragraph">One reason for this could be that C and C++ were more prevalent in <br>those days than Java, the other most curriculum was designed to teach C <br>and C++, and there was no <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/03/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018.html">Python</a> those days, at least not in our college.</div><div class="paragraph">This is true, *<em>often we don&apos;t make a choice</em>, and we learn as part of the programming curriculum at school and colleges. In my time, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-free-data-structure-and-algorithm-courses-java--c-programmers.html">C</a> was the first programming language in our engineering college, and then we learned C++, VB, VC++, and finally <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-free-courses-to-learn-java-in-2019-22d1f33a3915">Java</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">Now I am saying Java more straightforward and easy to learn, but I <br>still remember saying it was more complicated than C++ because I had to <br>type <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/10/eclipse-shortcut-to-systemoutprintln-in-java.html">System.out.println()</a> instead of simpler cout to print something on the screen, but that was just a momentary feeling.</div><div class="paragraph">When I started writing and maintaining bigger programs, I found Java <br>much more readable, and you can think what code is doing. Debugging and finding a problem was also much more comfortable in <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/11/top-5-free-java-courses-for-beginners.html#axzz4zuIICRs9">Java</a> than compared to <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html">C++</a> or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-free-data-structure-and-algorithm-courses-java--c-programmers.html">C</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">By the way, I learn professional programming, or you say real coding <br>only on my first job, and that was when I seriously started learning <br>Java.</div><h2>Is Java a Good Programming Language to Start With?</h2><div class="paragraph">Here are my couple of reasons, why I think Java is the right programming language to start learning to code:</div><div class="paragraph">1) Java is simpler, the syntax is much more readable than C, C++ or any other language.</div><div class="paragraph">2) Java is good to learn Object-Oriented programming, but not so good for procedural one, prefer C there. The OOP or <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-object-oriented-programming-online-courses.html">Object Oriented programming</a><br> is a useful skill because it handles the complexity of a real-world application quite well. It&apos;s easier to think in terms of class and <br>objects.</div><div class="paragraph">3) Java has a rich API, and you can do a lot more with Java including<br> graphics, sound and most likely writing small games like Tic Tac Toe, <br>Tetris, etc.</div><div class="paragraph">Not that you cannot do that with other languages, you often need to <br>download and install different modules and library, which is a tough job<br> for a starter. When you install <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/11/top-5-free-java-courses-for-beginners.html#axzz5bvMCbE00">Java</a>, most of these feature comes as part of the installation only.</div><div class="paragraph">4) Java has <strong>strong community support</strong>, no matter what<br> kind of questions, doubt, or issue you have, Google can find answers <br>for you. If not Google, then StackOverflow, Java forums and a lot of <br>other communities are there to help you out.</div><div class="paragraph">This is really the single biggest reason I suggest beginners <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/03/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-to-code.html">learn to code using Java</a> because when you are starting to learn to program you will face many different kinds of issues to understand for both programming <br>fundamentals and Java.</div><div class="paragraph">Because there are millions of Java developers around and a big community is there to support, most likely you will find answers quickly without getting frustrated and disappointed.</div><div class="paragraph">5) Java is a <strong><em>strongly typed language</em></strong>, which catches many newbie mistakes. Also valid, to a lesser extent, for static typing. This is another reason I suggest beginners <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/java-vs-python-which-programming-language-to-learn-first.html">learn Java first then Python</a> because Python is dynamic typing language, you don&apos;t need to define types which make learning confusing a bit.</div><div class="paragraph">6) Java comes with in-built Garbage collection, which is a big plus <br>for a complete beginner. Dealing with memory management is a big thing <br>at the start of learning programming.</div><div class="paragraph">These are some of the reasons why I think beginners should learn Java<br> first than any other language. I may be biased because I am a <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/10-tips-to-become-better-java-developer.html#axzz5jwmmAbXI">Java programmer</a>, but I also know <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-free-python-programming-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online-38312f3b9912">Python</a>, and I have also done professional programming in C and C++.  </div><div class="paragraph">From that experience, I can say that Java is undoubtedly one of the <em>best programming languages for beginners </em>and you can definitely choose Java as your first programming language to learn programming. <br></div><div class="paragraph">If you have already made up your mind to learn Java, then you can join <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F"><strong>The Complete Java Masterclass</strong></a> to start your journey into the beautiful world of Java. This is one of the best course to learn Java for beginners. It&apos;s comprehensive but at the same time hands-on and suitable for beginners.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><h2>Is Java Enough for a Successful Programming Career?</h2><div class="paragraph">Now the question is the difference, It&apos;s NOT. As a programmer, you must know a lot of things, like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/06/data-structure-and-algorithm-interview-questions-programmers.html">data structures, algorithms</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/04/top-5-courses-to-learn-jvm-internals.html">memory management</a>, <a href="http://java67.blogspot.sg/2013/02/class-in-java-and-object-oriented-programming-tutorial.html">object-oriented programming</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-shell-scripting-in-linux.html">scripting</a>, etc. and different language teaches you a different thing.</div><div class="paragraph">Once you are comfortable with Java, you can move to other useful programming languages like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/10-reasons-to-learn-scala-programming.html#axzz550Ppgfxg">Scala</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-javascript-courses-to-learn.html">JavaScript</a> or also go towards scripting langue&apos;s, like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/10-reasons-to-learn-python-programming.html">Python</a>, which doesn&apos;t need to be compiled.</div><div class="paragraph">To be successful in a programming career, you need to keep learning <br>and evolving, that&apos;s the biggest challenge of this field. If you happen <br>to love <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-data-structure-algorithms-and-programming-courses-to-crack-any-coding-interview-e1c50b30b927">programming</a> and learn new technologies and languages, then this is the right field for you.</div><div class="paragraph">Another important thing for a successful programmer is to develop <strong>debugging skill</strong>, which is a reasoning based skill. If you want to become a better Java developer, you can also see my recent post about <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/05/10-tips-to-become-better-java-developer.html">10 tips to become a better Java developer in 2019</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">If you are good with reasoning and can make a conclusion based upon <br>limited available information, then it will be easy for you to troubleshoot issues and find problems.</div><div class="paragraph">Having a good knowledge of IDE like <a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/03/10-tools-used-by-java-programming-Developers.html">Netbeans</a>, or <a href="https://itnext.io/top-5-intellijidea-and-android-studio-courses-for-java-and-android-programmers-afcc27309b60">IntelliJIDEA</a> will also help you with your coding and debugging journey, Java is blessed with a really excellent tool.</div><div class="paragraph">That&apos;s all on this folks. In my opinion, <strong>Java is definitely an excellent language to start programming with</strong>, because it&apos;s simpler than many others and focuses truly on programming rather than managing systems, like memory management.</div><div class="paragraph">If you are convinced to start learning to code with Java than pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596009208/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Head First Java</strong></a><strong> </strong>or join <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F"><strong>The Complete Java Masterclass</strong></a> and start your journey of programming with one of the best programming language, Java.</div><blockquote><div class="paragraph">In short, You can definitely <em>choose Java as your first programming language</em> and once you are comfortable, try to learn a couple of more, e.g. JavaScript or Python.</div></blockquote><div class="paragraph"><strong>More Resources</strong><br><a href="http://bit.ly/2zO3AHT">Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners (FREE)</a><br><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java%2F">Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java</a><br><a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fjava-fundamentals-language">Java Fundamentals: The Java Language</a><br><a href="http://bit.ly/2hgKrGO">Java Basics for Beginners (FREE Course)</a><br><a href="http://bit.ly/2hj03tp">Practice Java by Building Projects (FREE Course)</a><br><a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html">10 Free Java Courses for Beginners and Intermediate developers</a><br><a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/10-things-java-programmers-should-learn.html#axzz5atl0BngO">10 Things Java Developer should learn in 2019</a><br><a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/06/21-websites-to-learn-how-to-code-for.html">21 Websites to Learn Coding for FREE</a></div><div class="paragraph">Thanks for reading this article so far.
