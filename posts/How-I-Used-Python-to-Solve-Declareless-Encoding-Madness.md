<img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/uz1hy2dy9.png">                    <div class="paragraph">There is a very old <em>issue</em> regarding &#x201C;encoding detection&#x201D; in a text file that has been partially resolved by a program like <a href="https://github.com/chardet/chardet">Chardet</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">Nowadays, one could argue that this issue is not actually one. Indeed, <br>most standards are providing a way to declare the encoding, like in HTTP specifications.</div><div class="paragraph">But the reality is different, a huge part of the internet still have content with an unknown encoding. <em>One could point out subrip subtitle (SRT) for instance.</em></div><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/rg9pCHaE2Ja5bE2awCaVgNZ40H23-bn16n2ddn" alt></div><div class="paragraph">This is why a popular package like <a href="https://github.com/psf/Requests">Requests</a> list Chardet as a requirement to guess apparent encoding on remote resources.</div><div class="paragraph">But there is a catch. First of all, libraries like Chardet are unreliable, <br>unmaintained and sometime even disliked publicly by their owner. </div><div class="paragraph">Nearly all popular libraries are using the same idea, for each code page or encoding they want to detect they create a specific probe. They are <br>trying to identify originating encoding.</div><div class="paragraph">The first thing I did not like is the idea of single prober per encoding<br>table that could lead to hard coding specifications. Secondly, I am <br>convinced that we should not care about the originating encoding, that <br>because two different tables can produce two identical files.<br><br>This is where I came with an alternative. <strong>A crazy one :</strong> Using brute-force to get sense out of a given content. For each encoding there is.</div><ol><li>Exclude encoding that does not fit content at all</li><li>Measure observable chaos once opened, identify things like &#x201C;<em>&#x436;&#x413;&#x42A;&#x421;&#x42D; &#x42F;&#x43D;&#x201D;</em></li><li>Measure coherence by letter appearances frequencies</li></ol><div class="paragraph">By not creating specific probe per encoding I was able to provide <br>detection for around 90 encodings ! That&#x2019;s more than twice compared to <br>Chardet and it is actually more reliable.</div><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/rg9pCHaE2Ja5bE2awCaVgNZ40H23-6422d22" alt></div><div class="paragraph">So I present to you <a href="https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer">Charset Normalizer</a>.
