In fact, it&#x2019;s almost mandatory for a senior developer to learn more than one language.</p><p>Interviewers are giving more attention to an engineer who has good experience with multiple languages like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html">C++</a> and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html">Java</a> goes quite well, so is Python and&#xA0;Java.</p><p>I personally like Software Engineers who have strong experience in either C++ or Java and can write scripts in <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/06/top-5-books-to-learn-grails-framework-Java-Groovy.html">Groovy</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2CPSX8O">Perl</a>, or&#xA0;<a href="http://bit.ly/2qaUA9a">Python</a>.</p><p>Many times a small script is quick and good enough for the ad-hoc task and I don&#x2019;t want my programmer spending a full day in Java to <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/06/2-ways-to-parse-csv-files-in-java-example.html?ref=dzone">write a program to read CSV files</a> or to grab a message from a TCP/UDP&#xA0;port.</p><p>Why I chose these five programming languages? My reasons are simple and practical. I have chosen languages based on their usage, paradigm, and popularity.</p><p>For example, you cannot ignore <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/11/top-5-free-java-courses-for-beginners.html">Java</a> if you want to do application development and looking for a Job.

Though when it comes to online support, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/top-8-python-libraries-for-data-science-machine-learning.html">Python</a> is also great. There are lots of python modules available which can do your job in a couple of&#xA0;minutes.</p><p>Similarly learning an object-oriented and one functional programming language like Haskell or <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/10-reasons-to-learn-scala-programming.html">Scala</a> will widen your thinking and programming sense. You will find more reasons to learn these<em> top 5 programming languages</em> in this&#xA0;article.</p><h3>Top 5 Programming Languages Every Programmer Should&#xA0;Learn</h3><p>Without Further Ado, here is my list of 5 programming languages which every programmer or software developer should try to&#xA0;learn.</p><p>It contains a mix of languages e.g.<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/06/5-must-read-books-to-learn-object.html"> object-oriented</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2015/07/5-books-learn-java-8-functional-programming.html">functional</a>, scripting, language which offer a low level of control and language which is widely used in server-side development.</p><h3>1. Java</h3><p>Java is one of the most popular languages of the last two decade and rules the world of server-side application development. It also holds sizable market share in mobile games and application development using Android and enterprise web development world.</p><p>Java was started with a simple thought of WORA, <strong>&#x201C;write once run anywhere&#x201D;, </strong>but over the period, Java actually ran everywhere.</p><p>You should learn <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-free-java-8-and-9-courses-for-programmers.html">Java</a> to build robust, scalable server-side application. You can build projects of any complexity in Java, it has <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/10-tools-java-developers-should-learn.html">tools</a>, technology, and community to help&#xA0;with.</p><blockquote>Why should you learn Java? You will only have to focus on application design and code structuring without worrying about system-specific details and memory management. JVM will take care of&#xA0;it.</blockquote><p>If you decide to learn Java then <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F"><strong>The Complete Java Master Class</strong></a> on Udemy is a good course, to begin with.

Python</h3><p>Python is one of the most taught languages in school and colleges across the world. In the USA, Python has replaced Java from many academic courses as a preferred language to start with. What will you gain by learning Python? A&#xA0;lot.</p><p><a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/03/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018.html">Python </a>is one of that language which can be used as a scripting language as well as proper object-oriented language for a large&#xA0;project.</p><p>Many popular websites including Reddit are built upon Python frameworks like Django. In recent times, many large organizations are switching to the Python-based framework as&#xA0;well.</p><p>Python is also increasingly used for new generation technology like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-data-science-and-machine-learning-course-for-programmers-e724cfb9940a">machine learning</a>, artificial intelligence, and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-data-science-and-machine-learning-course-for-programmers-e724cfb9940a">data science</a>. No wonder, because it has got some awesome machine learning libraries like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-tensorflow-and-machine-learning-courses-online-programmers.html">TensorFlow</a>, Scikit-Learn, and&#xA0;<a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/top-8-python-libraries-for-data-science-machine-learning.html">others</a>.</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2ytcZzp">Complete Guide to TensorFlow for Deep Learning with Python</a></p><p>I personally use Python for writing scripts though and it is very useful for doing something quickly e.g. you can write a UDP message listener in 5 minutes in Python as opposed to 20 minutes in Java, forget about compiling, packaging and then using. Just write python scripts for ad-hoc&#xA0;tasks.</p><p>If you are interested in learning Python then <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcomplete-python-bootcamp%2F"><strong>The Complete Python BootCamp</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a great course to start&#xA0;with.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcomplete-python-bootcamp%2F"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*PSHP4v1aNN1rqRdq.png"></a></figure><p>Btw, If you need more choices and don&#x2019;t mind learning from FREE resources, then you can also check this list of <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-python-online-courses-for-beginners.html"><strong>free Python courses</strong></a> for beginners.</p><p>Also, If you are confused between Java and Python to start with, take a look at this <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/11/java-vs-python-which-programming-laungage-to-learn-first.html">infographic</a>, which compares Java with&#xA0;Python.</p><blockquote>And, if you still not convinced, then you should check my post about <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/05/10-reasons-to-learn-python-programming.html">10 reasons to learn Python in&#xA0;2018</a>.</blockquote><h3>3. JavaScript</h3><p>You can replace Java with C++ and Python to <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-ruby-and-rails-courses-to-learn-online.html">Ruby</a> in this list but honestly, <strong>there is no replacement of JavaScript in today&#x2019;s world</strong>. In the last 5 years, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/03/10-difference-between-java-and-javascript-programming.html">JavaScript</a> has totally dominated the&#xA0;world.</p><p>It is no more a client-side scripting language, with the framework and libraries like <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html">Node JS</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/5-best-courses-to-learn-angular.html">Angular</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-react-js-and-redux-courses-to-learn-online.html">React</a> you can use JavaScript on Server side as well for user interface development.</p><p>Some part of JavaScript&#x2019;s this overwhelming success goes to <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/02/top-16-jquery-interview-questions.html">jQuery</a>, which truly changed the way you use JavaScript on the client&#xA0;side.</p><p>As a Java programmer, working on <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-servlet-jsp-and-jdbc-online-courses-for-java-developers.html">JSP</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/09/dispatcherservlet-of-spring-mvc-10-points-to-remember.html#axzz5K0Pab1Qp">Servlet</a> based application I have had numerous opportunity to use both <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-jquery-courses-for-web-developers.html">jQuery</a> and JavaScript.</p><p>Knowledge of this language has helped us to decide which feature should be implemented server-side and which can be handled at client side e.g. many validations we used to do on the server side was migrated to the client&#xA0;side.</p><p>If you want to learn JavaScript from scratch and in-depth then <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-complete-javascript-course%2F"><strong>The Complete JavaScript</strong></a> course on Udemy is the best online course you can&#xA0;join.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-complete-javascript-course%2F"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*s_Nnef26Vin95zSP.png"></a></figure><p>If you need more choices and don&#x2019;t mind learning from FREE resources, then you can also check this list of<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-javascript-courses-to-learn.html"><strong>free JavaScript courses</strong></a> for web developers.</p><h3>4. C Programming</h3><p>You cannot be a true programmer without knowing C or C++. This is a very strong statement but I am saying this from my years of experience.</p><blockquote>Software engineers and developers who know C/C++ are simply better than programmers who don&#x2019;t know C and it cannot be just a plain coincident.</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s one of that language which you must know. I learned C during my academics and learned many key programming concepts along the way e.g. structure, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/06/top-20-array-interview-questions-and-answers.html#axzz4tUeeQOAU">array</a>, pointers, memory management etc.</p><p>The C is still the most preferred language for system programming and it has given Java a solid competition at the top of the table from last two&#xA0;years.</p><p>If you want to learn this wonderful language then <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fc-programming-for-beginners%2F"><strong>C Programming for Beginners</strong></a> is a good place to start&#xA0;with.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fc-programming-for-beginners%2F"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*ffwmSefUsTRvhm55.jpg"></a></figure><p>It is also one of the <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/03/top-10-popular-programming-languages-and-creators.html">oldest mainstream languages</a>, survived for more than 4 decades&#xA0;now.</p><p>Btw, if you want to learn C++ instead of C then also it&#x2019;s not bad as they are quite similar and allows you to write low-level code for systems and&#xA0;drivers.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also one of the important language for Game developers because of high performance it&#xA0;offers.</p><p>If you want to make games and learn C++ then <a href="http://bit.ly/2AItcqs"><strong>The Unreal Engine Developer Course&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Learn C++ &amp; Make Games</strong></a> is one of the best course.

Scala</strong></h3><p>Scala is the language which is created based on the best practices of the last 20 years. It is also a functional programming language so it offers a different paradigm than <a href="http://java67.blogspot.com/2015/12/top-30-oops-concept-interview-questions-answers-java.html">object-oriented programming</a>, which will improve your thinking and code&#xA0;sense.</p><p>Though there are many functional programming languages available e.g. Haskell, I have chosen Scala because as a Java developer, I found learning Scala is easy than <a href="http://bit.ly/2CMSJzE">learning&#xA0;Haskell</a>.</p><p>Someone can take that as a challenge and learn Haskell as well but for the practical purpose, I think learning <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/11/scala-vs-java-differences-similarities-books.html">Scala is more relevant for Java developers</a>.</p><p>For C++ programmers, Haskell makes more sense to me. To be honest, you can choose any functional programming language but chose one which has commercial demand.</p><p>As a professional developer, I prefer to invest my time on something which can be used in my career and if you want to learn Scala then <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fbeginning-scala-programming%2F">Beginning Scala Programming</a> is a good course, to begin&#xA0;with.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fbeginning-scala-programming%2F"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*OZlLQxEjSkNmPXle.png"></a></figure><p>Btw, no matter how many programming languages you learn, you must follow the coding and design principles given in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Clean Code</strong></a> by heart to become a professional coder. It&#x2019;s those skill which helps you most in your programming career.</p><p>That&#x2019;s all on this list of <strong>top 5 programming language every software engineer should learn</strong>. Some of you might find the list as 5 programming language Java developer should learn, which is also&#xA0;right.</p><p>IMHO studying languages that offer <em>different </em>paradigms is the best way to improve your programming skill and help you to do your day to day task effectively.</p><p>Ideally, a programmer&#x2019;s toolset should include one language which is close to system e.g. C or C++, one object-oriented language like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-java-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online.html">Java</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2ytsDuO">Python</a>, or <a href="http://bit.ly/2AItcqs">C++</a>, one functional programming language e.g. Scala or Haskell, one powerful scripting language like Perl, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-python-online-courses-for-beginners.html">Python </a>or <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-ruby-and-rails-courses-to-learn-online.html">Ruby</a>, and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-javascript-courses-to-learn.html">JavaScript</a>.
