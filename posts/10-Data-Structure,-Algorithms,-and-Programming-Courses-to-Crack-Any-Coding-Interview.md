It is, in fact, one of the hardest things in your life and you need to put your best effort to find a job in your dream&#xA0;company.</p><p>Most of the computer science graduates dream of working for <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2012/01/google-interview-questions-answers-top.html">Google</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/02/50-programmer-phone-interview-questions-answers.html">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2016/01/top-20-amazon-and-google-programming-interview-questions.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/12/30-microsoft-interview-questions-for-software-development-engineers.html">Microsoft</a>, and Apple but only a few programmers clear their difficult coding interviews.</p><p>The single most important reason for failing those coding job interviews is the lack of knowledge and practice. It pretty obvious that if you don&#x2019;t know what to learn then you are bound to fail, hence it becomes increasingly important that you prepare hard in&#xA0;advance.</p><p>Unfortunately, I learned this a little too late, after spoiling my chances at Microsoft and Amazon, but you don&#x2019;t need to. You can learn from my experience and <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fdeveloper-job-interviews">prepare better for your programming job interviews</a>.</p><p>So, the big question is, how do you prepare for coding/programming job interviews? Which subjects should you read up on? Which questions will you need to solve? How do you deal with coding and other technology related questions?</p><p>When I was hunting for my first job there wasn&#x2019;t much help available; we were totally reliant on our textbooks of programming languages and data structure to prepare for interviews, but things have changed in last 10&#xA0;years.</p><p>Nowadays, you not only have dedicated books to prepare for the coding interview, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><em>Crack the Coding Interview Questions</em></a><em>,</em> but you have <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-structure-and-algorithms-analysis%2F">online courses</a> and Coding Bootcamps to practice for coding interviews.</p><figure><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*tzHjzcWXnxF6k4qp.png"></a></figure><p>I really like the boot camps because of their methodology, focus, and rigorous practice but they are a bit expensive and not every computer science graduate who is looking for a job can afford&#xA0;that.</p><p>Another option is online courses like <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fsoftware-engineer-interview-unleashed%2F">Software Engineer Interview Unleashed</a>, which are both cheap and provide you similar kind of interactive guidance you get in coding boot&#xA0;camps.</p><p>There are a lot of coding interview courses available on popular course sites like <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-10-udemy-courses-for-java-and-web-developers.html">Udemy</a> and <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/12/top-10-pluralsight-courses-java-and-web-developers.html#axzz53viuJDer">PluralSight</a> but you need to choose the right course which can help you to achieve your&#xA0;goal.</p><h3>10 Data Structure and Algorithm Courses for Programming Interviews</h3><p>In this article, I am going to share some of the best online courses to prepare for coding/programming job interviews, and based upon your experience and skill set, you can choose one or two courses from this list to prepare for your next job interview.</p><p>Most of these courses are focused on <a href="https://hackernoon.com/50-data-structure-and-algorithms-interview-questions-for-programmers-b4b1ac61f5b0">data structure and algorithms</a>, which are the most important topics for any coding interview but they also teach you problem-solving and other aspects of Job interview e.g. questions from a programming language like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html">Java</a> and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html">C++</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html">Database</a>, and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-oracle-and-microsoft-sql-server-online-courses.html">SQL </a>concepts, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-linux-unix-courses-for-programmers-learn-online.html">Linux commands</a>, etc.</p><p>Once you have gone through one of these online training courses, you would have enough knowledge to take on your job interview as well know where to go for further improvement.</p><h3><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-structure-and-algorithms-analysis%2F">1.

You will also learn how to find Big-O for every data structure.</p><p>By the end, you will be able to write code that runs faster and uses low memory. You also will learn how to analyze problems using one technique many programmers forgot to&#xA0;prepare.</p><p>This is an ideal course for all levels of programmers, particularly Java programmers.
