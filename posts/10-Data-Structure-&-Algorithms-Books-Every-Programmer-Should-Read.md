Unfortunately, I have come across several programmers who are <em>REALLY </em>good on programming languages like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html">Java</a> or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/10-free-python-courses-for-programmers.html">Python</a> like knows minor details of API and language intricacies but has very poor knowledge of fundamentals Algorithms and Data Structure.</p><p>Just ask them to implement any popular sorting algorithms like <a href="http://java67.blogspot.sg/2014/07/quicksort-algorithm-in-java-in-place-example.html">quicksort</a> or <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/03/mergesort-in-java-algorithm-example-and.html">merge sort</a> and they will fall apart. If you expect them to know more advanced and complex algorithms like<a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/top-20-string-coding-problems-from-programming-job-interviews-493m"> String algorithms</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2NAbaIR">graph algorithms</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/10/post-order-binary-tree-traversal-in-java-iteration-recursion.html">tree traversal</a> or greedy algorithms, be ready to check on Interviews, otherwise, you might end up with some surprises.<br> <br>Once, I come across a very good candidate for a core Java senior developer role, he was excellent in Java, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-5-java-multithreading-and-concurrency-courses-experienced-programmers.html">multi-threading</a> but his data structure and algorithm skill was really poor to his experience and caliber.<br> <br>When I asked him, why he didn&#x2019;t spend time brushing his algorithm and problem-solving skill before coming to the interview? His excuse was <em>&#x201C;those algorithms are just for interviews and never really used in practical coding. I have never used them in my 6 years of Java development career&#x201D;</em>.<br> <br>He was somewhat right, you don&#x2019;t need to implement a hash table in Java, you can always use the <a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/08/top-10-java-hashmap-interview-questions.html">HashMap</a> class or Dictionary in Python for that sense but he failed to recognize the more long term improvement algorithm and data structure do in <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/01/10-tips-to-improve-programming-skill-become-better-programmer.html">improving programming skill</a>.<br> <br>Algorithms are tools of developing programming solving skill and coding sense, which is required to convert a user requirement into the line of code also known as a computer program.<br> <br>They are also all around, if you use Facebook, have you ever thought about how they find your friends so easily? Or how does Netflix recommends the movie you want to watch? Those are just a couple of examples of <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fmachine-learning-algorithms"><strong>Machine Learning Algorithms</strong></a>, which is taking Algorithms into another&#xA0;level.</p><h3>10 Algorithm Books&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Must Read for Developers</h3><p>Another gold tip to those who think that Algorithms are Data Structures are for those who want to work in <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/01/top-20-amazon-and-google-programming-interview-questions.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/01/google-interview-questions-answers-top.html">Google</a>, Facebook, Intel or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/12/30-microsoft-interview-questions-for-software-development-engineers.html">Microsoft</a>, remember it is the only skill which is timeless, of course apart from <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-linux-unix-courses-for-programmers-learn-online.html">UNIX</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-database-and-sql-query-courses-programmers.html">SQL</a>, and C.<br> <br>Programming languages come and go, but the core of programming, which is algorithm and data structure remains the same.<br> <br>If you know how a hash table works then you can use their implementation in any programming language like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2013/02/10-examples-of-hashmap-in-java-programming-tutorial.html">HashMap</a> from JDK, Dictionary in <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018-best-of-lot-26644a99e7ec">Python</a>, or HashMap from <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-c-courses-to-learn-programming-in-2019-d27352277da0">C++</a> boost library.<br> <br>So, if you are serious about programming and realizing it now that algorithms and data structure is not optional, here are some of the great books to learn algorithms.<br> <br>Some of you might have already read them before but they are worth reading again.<br> <br> <br> <br><strong>1. </strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Edition-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H.

The current edition of this books is the 3rd Edition and I strongly suggest that every programmer should have this in their bookshelf, but only for short reading and references.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not possible to finish this book in one sitting and some of you may find it difficult to read as well, but don&#x2019;t worry, you can combine your learning with an online course like <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java%2F">Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java</a> along with this&#xA0;book.</p><p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java%2F">Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java</a></p><p>This is like the best of both world, you learn basic Algrotihsm quickly in an online course and then you further cement that knowledge by going through the book, which would make more sense to you now that you have gone through a course already.<br> <br>Another reason I recommend this book as one of the first books on algorithm because of its language agnostic and accompanied by lectures&#xA0;<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm">here</a></p><figure><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Edition-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/270/0*qyn7oS5yEK8kX5-Y.jpeg"></a></figure><p><strong>2. </strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick &amp; Kevin Wayne</strong></a><br>This was my preferred resource on algorithms for a long time, it still is but now I see it less often than before.
