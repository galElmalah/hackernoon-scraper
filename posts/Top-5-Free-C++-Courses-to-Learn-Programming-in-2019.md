There is a huge demand for good C++ developers, especially in the area of high-frequency trading where every microsecond matters.<br> <br>C++ is the language which provides the best of both world, it allows you to use <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-object-oriented-programming-online-courses.html">OOP</a> to manage the complexity of software but at the same time, it also allows you to get close to your machine and access all of your computer&#x2019;s hardware, which is not easily possible for other object-oriented languages like <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/11/top-5-free-java-courses-for-beginners.html#axzz4zuIICRs9">Java</a> or <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-python-online-courses-for-beginners.html">Python</a>.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the reason C++ is heavily used for writing native device drivers, high-end desktop games and complex artificial intelligence programs where you need high performance.<br> <br>In this article, I am going to share with you some of the best courses to learn C++ online at your own time and place and free of cost. You can use these courses if you are starting with programming or you have some experience in coding but not familiar with&#xA0;C++.</p><h3>5 Courses to learn C++ Free&#xA0;Online</h3><p>I love learning new technologies and programming language because they expand your knowledge, give a boost to your resume and set you apart from your competition, but learning a new programming language is not easy. It takes time, practice and dedication to learn new stuff.<br> <br>Though you can easily learn new things by following my 3 points formula, which I have used to learn several new things e.g. <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-kotlin-programming-java-android.html#axzz56R4AatoQ">Kotlin</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/10-free-docker-container-courses-for-Java-Developers.html#axzz572i5LgQK">Docker</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/6-free-maven-and-jenkins-online-courses-for-java-developers.html">Maven</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html">JUnit</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/01/top-5-free-angular-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html">Angular</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-react-courses-for-web-developers.html">ReactJS</a> in last a couple of years. It&#x2019;s practical and works well.<br> <br>The first point is to join an online course, free or paid, to start with a new programming language. Once you get hold of basic stuff and understand the vocabulary of the technology, you can start with the 2nd point, which is reading a book.<br> <br>This is also optional, if you join a good course then you can start writing code immediately but if you want to learn things in depth, choosing the right book is the best way&#xA0;forward.</p><p>In general, books contain more information than online courses and also written by the authority on the subject matters. For C++, you can see my list of books here.<br> <br>After that, you should build a project, that&#x2019;s the most important step where you use all the knowledge you have learned. At the step, you go back and forth to the course and book to repeat and refer, which consolidates your learning.<br> <br>If you follow these three steps then you can easily learn a new programming language, library, framework or new stuff quickly. Anyway, here is my list of free C++ courses to learn programming.<br> <br> <br><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ffree-learn-c-tutorial-beginners%2F"><strong>C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners</strong></a><br> This is an awesome course to learn C++ and you can get this on Udemy for free of cost.<br> <br>This <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ffree-learn-c-tutorial-beginners%2F">course</a> teaches you the powerful, fast and popular C++ programming language from scratch, assuming only basic computer knowledge.<br> <br>You will start with setting up your development environment and then learn the basic syntax and building blocks of programming.
