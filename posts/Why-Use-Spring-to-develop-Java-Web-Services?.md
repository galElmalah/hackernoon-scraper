It has provided dedicated annotations, e.g. <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/08/difference-between-restcontroller-and-controller-annotations-spring-mvc-rest.html"><strong>@RestController</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/09/spring-interview-questions-answers-j2ee.html#axzz55mVSPFfH"><strong>@ResponseStatus</strong></a> to make the development of RESTful resources even easier in Spring&#xA0;4.0.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also not only help you to create RESTful web services but also provides classes to consume REST resources, e.g. you can use the <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/02/how-to-consume-json-from-restful-web-services-Spring-RESTTemplate-Example.html"><strong>RestTemplate</strong></a><strong> </strong>class to consume RESTful resources.</p><p>There are many more utility classes and annotations which make the development of RESTful web services in Spring easier and seamless and I&#x2019;ll share a couple of them in this article to prove my point that using Spring to develop RESTful Web service is the right decision.</p><h3>7 Reasons to Use Spring for Creating RESTful Web Services in&#xA0;Java</h3><p>As I told you in the first paragraph, we can use Spring MVC to create and consume RESTful web services. Now, let&#x2019;s see those supports in a little bit more details so that you can make the best use of them and quickly develop the RESTful services you always&#xA0;wanted.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> In Spring MVC, a controller can handle the requests for all HTTP methods, which is a backbone of RESTful web services. For example, you can handle a GET method to perform read operations, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2016/10/difference-between-put-and-post-in-restful-web-service.html">POST</a> methods to create resources, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2016/09/when-to-use-put-or-post-in-restful-web-services.html">PUT</a> methods to update resources, and DELETE methods to remove resources from the&#xA0;server.</p><p>From Spring 3.2 onwards, you can also handle PATCH requests. By the way, if you are not familiar with the Spring MVC framework, then you should first take a look at that; <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-mvc-tutorial-for-beginners-step-by-step%2F">Spring MVC For Beginners</a> is a good place to&#xA0;begin.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-mvc-tutorial-for-beginners-step-by-step%2F"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*XF39gw6pVak96d6XP3gEPw.jpeg"></a></figure><p><strong>2.</strong> In the case of REST, the representation of data is very important and that&#x2019;s why Spring MVC allows you to bypass View-based rendering altogether by using the @ResponseBody annotation and various HttpMessgeConverterimplementations.</p><p>By using this, you can directly send a response to a client, e.g. the resource clients want and also in the format they want. See <a href="http://courses.baeldung.com/p/rest-with-spring-the-certification-class?affcode=22136_bkwjs9xa">here </a>to learn more about HttpMessageConvert and @ResponseBody annotation.</p><figure><a href="http://courses.baeldung.com/p/rest-with-spring-the-certification-class?affcode=22136_bkwjs9xa"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*3TbwpBINLVfEsv2v.png"></a></figure><p><strong>3.</strong> The Spring 4.0 release added a dedicated annotation, @RestController, to make the development of RESTful web services even&#xA0;easier.</p><p>If you annotate your controller class using @RestController instead of <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/08/difference-between-restcontroller-and-controller-annotations-spring-mvc-rest.html">@Controller</a> then Spring applies message conversations to all handler methods in the controller.</p><p>This means you don&#x2019;t need to annotate each method with the @ResponseBodyannotation. This also makes your code much&#xA0;cleaner.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>One of the main differences between a REST web service and a normal web application is that the REST pass resource identifies data in the URI itself, e.g. /messages/101, while web applications normally use a query parameter, e.g. /messages?Id=101.</p><p>If you remember, we use <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/10/differences-between-requestparam-and-pathvariable-annotations-spring-mvc.html">@RequestParam</a> to get the value of those query parameters but, not to worry, Spring MVC also provides a <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/10/differences-between-requestparam-and-pathvariable-annotations-spring-mvc.html">@PathVariable</a>annotation which can extract data from a URL. It allows the controller to handle requests for parameterized URLs.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Another key aspect of RESTful web services is Representation, meaning the same resource can be represented in different formats, i.e. JSON, XML, HTML, etc. Thankfully, Spring provides several view implementations and views resolvers to render data as <a href="http://www.java67.com/2016/10/3-ways-to-convert-string-to-json-object-in-java.html#.WkOmLRqktTU.linkedin">JSON</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/07/how-to-read-xml-file-as-string-in-java-example.html#axzz55mVSPFfH">XML</a>, and&#xA0;<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2014/09/how-to-parse-html-file-in-java-jsoup-example.html">HTML</a>.</p><p>For example, ContentNegotiatingViewResolver can look at the file extension of requests or Accept header to find out the correct representation of a resource for the&#xA0;client.</p><p><strong>6. </strong>Similar to the @ResponseBody annotation, which is used for converting the response to the format client wants (by using HttpMessageConverts), Spring MVC also provides @RequestBody annotation, which uses HttpMethodConverter implementations to convert inbound HTTP data into Java objects passed into a controller&apos;s handler&#xA0;method.</p><p>If you are not familiar with handler methods and Spring MVC in general, then you can also check out <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/how-to-learn-spring-core-spring-mvc-boot-security-framework.html">3 ways to learn Spring&#xA0;MVC</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-mvc-tutorial-for-beginners-step-by-step%2F"><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*gbFt9EjXvR_wsD4A.png"></a></figure><p><strong>7. </strong>The<strong> </strong>Spring framework also provides a template class, RestTemplate, which is similar to JdbcTemplate, and JmsTemplate, which can consume REST resources. You can use this class to <a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/10/how-to-test-restful-web-services-using.html">test your RESTful web service</a> or develop REST&#xA0;clients.</p><p>These were some of the <strong>important features of the Spring MVC framework</strong>which assist in developing RESTful web services. As I said earlier, the most important reason for me to choose Spring for developing RESTful resources is that I can use my existing knowledge of the framework, which means no steep learning&#xA0;curve.</p><p>If you look at it from a high level, developing RESTful services is not very different from developing a web application.</p><p>The fundamental difference is that in the case of the former, we mostly deal with human users where in case of REST you have to deal with non-human users, mostly rich JavaScript clients and mobile applications.</p><p>This key difference then causes other differences, e.g. representing data in JSON or XML instead of HTML which is suitable for human users but not for non-human systems.
