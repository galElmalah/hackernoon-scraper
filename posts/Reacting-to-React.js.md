<img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/40v30fn.png">                    <div class="paragraph">Literally a month ago there was excitement in the Vue.js community that Vue.js got more stars than <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/react">React</a>.js on github. Stars like Hollywood stars? Really, no lol, but maybe metaphorically&#x2026; or philosophically?</div><div class="paragraph">Github stars is a way for developers to effectively bookmark that page so that they can refer to it later on. What does this mean? That Vue&#x2019;s popularity has surpassed React, a symbolic handing over of the frontend baton, if you will.</div><div class="paragraph">So everyone is using Vue.js and its more popular then React? Well no, stars don&#x2019;t mean usage, but we can look at npm downloads which is what is used to install these and see that Vue is still pretty far behind;</div><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/JTw2M3rQabaxNg3EFoNIxjmC1ZB3-dl6307y" alt></div><div class="paragraph">(stats via <a href="http://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-vue">http://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-vue</a>)</div><div class="paragraph">With technologies being used all the time, businesses have to decide whether it is worth their time and therefore money to upgrade to more newer ones.

One of the biggest skillsets of developers is being able to solve problems by finding solutions online. But its also important to be aware of the age of these solutions. Quite a few tutorials were out there, but they are outdated and can lead you down a rabbit hole before realising.</div><div class="paragraph">Facebook&#x2019;s repo <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> is the best way to start.

ES6 is prevalent in React, so make sure you got these down before you jump in or it will be confusing as hell!</div><div class="paragraph">Like Vue, we&#x2019;re working with Components. Components are the whole reason we love React and Vue. We are splitting up our website into Components that are reusable.

You have your imports at the top, a component class which contains everything, then your export.</div><div class="paragraph">Inside the component class you will almost always have a render function which is the stuff that gets parsed to the page. The render function always returns JSX code which will contain everything you want to render.</div><div class="paragraph">Inside the render function here we got divs, a h1 tag, and &#x2018;&lt;BookmarkForm /&gt;&#x2019; which is another component.</div><div class="paragraph">There are also other in built functions that you can use that are on the same level as the render function, but still within the component class. You can also have custom functions that you may want to use.</div><div class="paragraph">Whats great is that these functions are limited to this class component scope, meaning they can only be accessed within this component, unless you want it not to do so.</div><div class="paragraph">Probably the most common question for learning React is&#x2026; what on earth is JSX??</div><h2>JSX&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Everything is Javascript</h2><div class="paragraph">ES6 controversially introduced Classes to Javascript due to demand. But really under the hood it is nothing more then syntactic sugar. Meaning it looks and acts like Classes in other languages but its actually not doing anything different then it was before.</div><div class="paragraph">This is the same with JSX.

In simple terms, this means we are passing the name of the website down to the WebsiteChoice component so that we can do something with it, and let the WebsiteChoice component handle it rather then the parent.</div><div class="paragraph">So in the WebsiteChoice component;</div><div class="code-container"><pre style="display:block;overflow-x:auto;background:black;color:#eaeaea;padding:30px"><code><span class="hljs-class"><span style="color:#c397d8">class</span> <span style="color:#7aa6da">WebsiteChoice</span> <span style="color:#c397d8">extends</span> <span style="color:#7aa6da">React</span>.<span style="color:#7aa6da">Component</span> </span>{    render() {        <span style="color:#c397d8">return</span> (            <span class="xml"><span style="color:#d54e53">&lt;<span style="color:#d54e53">li</span>&gt;</span>                </span>&lt;div className=&quot;website-choice-container&quot;&gt;                    &lt;span className=&quot;website-choice&quot;&gt;                        &lt;a href={`http://${this.props.website}`}&gt;                            {this.props.website}                        &lt;/a&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;<span class="xml">            <span style="color:#d54e53">&lt;/<span style="color:#d54e53">li</span>&gt;</span></span>        );    }}</code></pre></div><div class="paragraph">Here we pass in the name of the website by calling &#x2018;this.props.website&#x2019; and set it to the href, and render it to the page, thus allowing this component to be responsible for anything to do with each individual website.</div><h2>Save Yourself This Dot Headaches</h2><div class="paragraph">One of the interesting parts to Javascript is using the keyword this. This, is a way of referring to things within a certain object. This <a href="http://davidshariff.com/blog/javascript-this-keyword/">blog</a> explains it super well.</div><div class="paragraph">So when we are passing around these bits of information via props, we can also pass functions too which can sit in the parent component but be called in the child component.</div><div class="paragraph">However, since we are passing around objects, the keyword this can be referring to the wrong objects. So its super useful to know ES6 arrow functions here, since they allow the this keyword to not refer to the function object that&#x2019;s created.</div><div class="paragraph">So instead of</div><div class="code-container"><pre style="display:block;overflow-x:auto;background:black;color:#eaeaea;padding:30px"><code><span class="hljs-function"><span style="color:#c397d8">function</span> <span style="color:#7aa6da">doSomething</span>(<span style="color:#e78c45"></span>) </span>{    <span style="color:#969896">// some code</span>}</code></pre></div><div class="paragraph">use</div><div class="code-container"><pre style="display:block;overflow-x:auto;background:black;color:#eaeaea;padding:30px"><code>doSomething = <span class="hljs-function"><span style="color:#e78c45">()</span> =&gt;</span> {    <span style="color:#969896">// some code</span>}</code></pre></div><div class="paragraph">to avoid scoping problems. This allows a child component to be able to call the passed down this.props.doSomething from its own component.</div><div class="paragraph">If you remember above we had that weird &#x2018;super&#x2019; keyword with props inside it.</div><div class="code-container"><pre style="display:block;overflow-x:auto;background:black;color:#eaeaea;padding:30px"><code><span class="hljs-class"><span style="color:#c397d8">class</span> <span style="color:#7aa6da">App</span> <span style="color:#c397d8">extends</span> <span style="color:#7aa6da">Component</span> </span>{     <span style="color:#c397d8">constructor</span>(props) {          <span style="color:#c397d8">super</span>(props);              <span style="color:#c397d8">this</span>.state = {   <span class="hljs-attr">websites</span>: []  };     }     render() {<span style="color:#969896">//JSX rendering stuff...</span></code></pre></div><div class="paragraph">In React, when you call super with props. React will make props available across the component through this.props. This allows us to call this.props.websites when the data is on the parent component.</div><h2>Deployment to&#xA0;Heroku</h2><div class="paragraph">There&#x2019;s a lot more to the code but this post is starting to get a bit too long.

That being said, the community is huge and with Facebook&#x2019;s &#x2018;backing&#x2019;, its surely still quite a safe bet that it stick around for the foreseeable future.</div><div class="paragraph">I think that being able to use ES6 is almost a must for react, considering the scoping problems that you will get by using traditional non arrow function functions, dealing with putting binds everywhere to control your this&#x2019;s!</div><div class="paragraph">For me, if Vue didn&#x2019;t exist I&#x2019;d probably be a satisfied developer with React, but it was hard for me to code with the knowledge that things could be done in a much easier way&#x2026;</div><div class="youtube-container"><iframe title="ytcontainer" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mg7Ma5i8NgM" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><div class="paragraph">(From the youtube channel DevTips!)</div><div class="paragraph">I want to end with a pretty cool series video of what its like to develop a project from start to finish, concept to working prototype.
