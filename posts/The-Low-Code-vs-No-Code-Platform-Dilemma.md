<img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/f6g532j8.png">                              <div class="paragraph">As time progressed, programming methods became simpler so that applications can be developed and delivered fast. This led to the popularity of low-code and later no-code approach to application development. Both low-code and no-code take a drag-and-drop visual approach to build business applications more efficiently. The idea is to reduce or replace complicated coding with a configuration approach. This allows citizen developers to build and test applications quickly.</div><h1>Decoding the low-code platform</h1><div class="paragraph">Low-code platforms began when developers started replacing traditional hand-coding with tools &#x2013; pre-built modules, graphical interfaces - to create applications. These platforms came into existence as auto-code generation tools. Later, they evolved into enterprise-grade app development platforms and now it covers the entire app delivery cycle. Let&#x2019;s look at how low-code platforms optimize the app delivery cycle:</div><ul><li>By replacing coding with simple drag-and-drop UI components, developers can build the end-user experience right from the start</li><li>Services like database, SOAP and REST APIs, CRM, security, and other external services are integrated into the application visually&#xA0;</li><li>Front-end, back-end codes are automatically generated based on standard best practices</li><li>The continuous deployment and integration process is simplified as low-code platforms enable one-click deployment</li><li>It enables automatic maintenance and scalability of the deployed app with the help of containers</li></ul><div class="paragraph">These features, though, were not enough for some developers. The fact that certain implementations required coding made developers apprehensive of using low-code development tools. This is when no-code development approach came into the picture.</div><h1>Low-code vs no-code platforms</h1><div class="paragraph">We know that low-code development approach ironed out many difficulties of using traditional methods to create apps. It allows users to build apps using predefined out-of-the-box components. But sometimes, there are features that require customization. For example, a developer may want to input a widget on the app screen which is not part of the default widget library of the platform. A low-code platform allows for developers to build such a widget and make it available as a drag-and-drop component for future projects.&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph">This may solve the problem but there can be another solution. A team of developers hired by the company can build a UI widget library based on the company&#x2019;s requirement and make it available out-of-the-box in the platform itself. App building then becomes a no-code experience.&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph">No-code platforms evolved as a specialized type of low-code cloud platform to address industry-specific functions. In such scenarios, the coding extensions are taken care of by providing out-of-the-box visual components. There are many advanced software tools in the market that allow developers to extend the capabilities of no-code platforms - nested data, automatically generated database, offline use and more - without compromising on any functionality. This capability can be extended to handle more complex requirements as well.&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph">In other words, no-code platforms can be great for business users wanting to build small applications for use by a single department. But the problem with these apps are that they don&#x2019;t scale well and integration capabilities are often limited.&#xA0;</div><h1>How to choose between the two?</h1><div class="paragraph">In deciding any strategy for application development, there&#x2019;s more to it than just the technology. It depends on what kind of apps you want to create. No-code platform is likely to be a good fit for building line-of-business apps when you have limited IT resources. <a href="https://www.wavemaker.com/low-code-app-development-platform">Low-code</a> development platforms are a good choice for professional developers wanting to create long-term custom applications that are critical to the business.&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph">When considering either of the platforms, make sure it meets the following requirements for best results:&#xA0;</div><ul><li>What does your solution do to facilitate business?</li><li>Do you need to integrate or add functionalities to the solution?</li><li>How does it support citizen and professional developers to create applications?</li><li>Can the solution be enhanced to deliver customized functions?</li><li>Where you want to host your solution</li></ul><div class="paragraph">Both the platforms improve app-building efficiency for faster time-to-value. Based on your needs, choose the platform that helps to speed up the app development process and helps your business scale.&#xA0;<br><br></div>                    <h2 class="tags-header">Tags</h2>          <div class="archive-tags">                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/low-code-platform">Low Code Platform</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/no-code-platform">No Code Platform</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/coding">Coding</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/applications">Applications</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/containers">Containers</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/low-code">Low Code</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/no-code">No Code</a>                                                <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming">Programming</a>                      </div>                                        <div class="twitter-discussion">            <a target="_blank" href="https://community.hackernoon.com/t/19924">Continue the Discussion <i class="fas fa-comments-alt"></i></a>          </div>
