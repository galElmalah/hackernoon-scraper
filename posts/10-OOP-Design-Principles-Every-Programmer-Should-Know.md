<figure><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YwvHjyM-BLFizN_TkTvrLw.png"></figure><p>The Object-Oriented Design Principles<strong> </strong>are the core of OOP programming, but I have seen most of the Java programmers chasing design patterns like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/05/double-checked-locking-on-singleton-in-java.html">Singleton pattern</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2013/07/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-real-life-example-tutorial.html">Decorator pattern</a>, or <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/12/observer-design-pattern-java-example.html">Observer pattern</a>, and not putting enough attention on learning <em>Object-oriented analysis and&#xA0;design</em>.</p><p>It&#x2019;s important to learn the basics of Object-oriented programming like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/04/difference-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation-in-java-oop.html">Abstraction</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-is-encapsulation-in-java-and-oops.html">Encapsulation</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/08/what-is-polymorphism-in-java-example.html">Polymorphism</a>, and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2016/03/top-21-java-inheritance-interview-Questions-Answer-Programming.html">Inheritance</a>. But, at the same time, it&#x2019;s equally important to know object-oriented design principles.</p><blockquote>They will help you to create a clean and modular design, which would be easy to test, debug, and maintain in the&#xA0;future.</blockquote><p>I have regularly seen Java programmers and developers of various experience level, who have either never heard about these <a href="http://www.java67.com/2015/12/top-30-oops-concept-interview-questions-answers-java.html">OOP</a> and <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fprinciples-oo-design">SOLID design principle</a><strong>,</strong> or simply doesn&#x2019;t know what benefits a particular design principle offers and how to apply these design principle in&#xA0;coding.</p><p>To do my part, I have jotted down all important object-oriented design principles and putting it here for quick reference. These will at least give you some idea about what they are and what benefit they offer.<br> <br>I have not put examples, just to keep the article short but you can find a lot of examples of these design principles on the internet and even on my <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/"><strong>Java blog</strong></a>, just use the search bar at the top of the page.<br> <br>If you are not able to understand a design principle, you should try to do more than one example because sometimes we connect to another example or author better but you must understand these design principles and learn how to use it in your code.<br> <br>Another thing you can do is to join a comprehensive object-oriented design course like <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fprinciples-oo-design"><strong>SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design</strong></a> by Steve Smith on Pluralsight.

DRY (Don&#x2019;t repeat yourself)</h3><p>Our first object-oriented design principle is DRY, as the name suggests <strong>DRY (don&#x2019;t repeat yourself)</strong> means don&#x2019;t write duplicate code, instead use <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2010/10/abstraction-in-java.html">Abstraction</a> to abstract common things in one&#xA0;place.</p><p>If you have a block of code in more than two places consider making it a separate method, or if you use a hard-coded value more than one time make them <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/12/final-variable-method-class-java.html">public final constant</a>. The benefit of this Object oriented design principle is in <strong>maintenance</strong>.</p><blockquote>It&#x2019;s important not to abuse it, duplication is not for code, but for functionality.</blockquote><p>It means if you have used common code to validate OrderId and SSN it doesn&#x2019;t mean they are the same or they will remain the same in&#xA0;future.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fbasics-of-software-architecture-design-in-java%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*I9HuckIG9IxgL_a0.jpg"></a></figure><p>By using common code for two different functionality or thing you closely couple them forever and when your OrderId changes its format, your SSN validation code will break.<br> <br>So beware of such coupling and just don&#x2019;t combine anything which uses the similar code but are not related.

Encapsulate What&#xA0;Changes</h3><p>There is only one thing which is constant in the software field and that is &#x201C;Change&#x201D;, So, encapsulate the code you expect or suspect to be changed in&#xA0;future.</p><blockquote>The benefit of this OOP Design principle is that It&#x2019;s easy to test and maintain proper encapsulated code.</blockquote><p>If you are coding in Java then follow the principle of <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2012/03/private-in-java-why-should-you-always.html#axzz559dyoLSA">making variable and methods private</a> by default and increasing access step by step like from a private to <a href="http://www.java67.com/2012/12/what-is-public-private-protected-package-default-private-access-modifier-java.html">protected </a>and not&#xA0;<a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/10/difference-between-private-protected-public-package-access-java.html#axzz5Y4Koqgj5">public</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fpatterns-library"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/0*sa7MD5_9K7a2euoU.jpg"></a></figure><p>Several of the <strong>design patterns in Java</strong> uses Encapsulation, the <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/12/factory-design-pattern-java-example.html">Factory design pattern</a> is one example of Encapsulation which encapsulates object creation code and provides flexibility to introduce a new product later with no impact on existing code.<br> <br>Btw, if you are interested in learning more about design patterns in Java and Object Oriented Programming then you must check this <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fpatterns-library"><strong>Design Pattern Library</strong></a> course Pluralsight. It&#x2019;s one of the best collection of design patterns and advice on how to use them in the real&#xA0;world.</p><h3>3. Open Closed Design Principle</h3><p>According to tho this OOP design principle, &#x201C;Classes, methods or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification&#x201D;.</p><p>This is another beautiful SOLID design principle, coined by Uncle Bob on his classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Clean Code</strong></a> book, which prevents someone from changing already tried and tested&#xA0;code.</p><blockquote>The key benefit of this design principle is that already tried and tested code is not touched which means they won&#x2019;t&#xA0;break.</blockquote><p>Here is a Java code example which <em>violates </em>the Open Closed Design Principle of Programming:</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fbasics-of-software-architecture-design-in-java%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GQfvM7PxzIqhqATZKOf5tA.jpeg"></a></figure><p>In this code GraphicEditor is tightly coupled with Shape, If you need a new Shape then you need to modify already tried and tested code inside thedrawShape(Shape s) method, which is both error-prone and not desirable.</p><p>Ideally, if you are adding new functionality only than your code should be tested and that&#x2019;s the goal of <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/11/great-example-of-open-closed-design.html">Open Closed Design principle</a>.</p><p>By the way, the Open-Closed principle is &#x201C;O&#x201D; from the SOLID acronym. If you want to learn more about this principle, the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fsolid-principles-object-oriented-design-architecture%2F"><strong>SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design and Architecture</strong></a> course on Udemy is one of the best resources to&#xA0;consult.</p><h3>4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3><p>Single Responsibility Principle is another SOLID design principle, and represent &#x201C;S&#x201D; on the SOLID acronym. As per SRP, there should not be more than one reason for a class to change, or a class should always handle single functionality.</p><blockquote>The key benefit of this principle is that it reduces coupling between the individual component of the software and&#xA0;Code.</blockquote><p>For example, If you put more than one functionality in one Class in Java it introduces <strong>coupling</strong> between two functionality and even if you change one functionality there is a chance you broke coupled functionality, which requires another round of testing to avoid any surprise on the production environment.<br> <br>You can further see <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ffrom-0-to-1-design-patterns%2F"><strong>From 0 to 1: Design Patterns&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;24 That Matter</strong></a><strong> </strong>course on Udemy to learn about patterns which are based on this principle.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ffrom-0-to-1-design-patterns%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*ND11FPv3yREYc0mT.jpg"></a></figure><h3>5. Dependency Injection or Inversion principle</h3><p>Don&#x2019;t ask for dependency it will be provided to you by the framework. This has been very well implemented in <a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html">Spring framework</a>, one of the most popular Java framework for writing real-worth applications.</p><blockquote>The beauty of this <strong>design principle</strong> is that any class which is injected by DI framework is <strong>easy to test</strong> with the mock object and easier to maintain because object creation code is centralized in the framework and client code is not littered with&#xA0;that.</blockquote><p>There are multiple ways to implemented <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/inversion-of-control-dependency-injection-design-pattern-spring-example-tutorial.html"><strong>Dependency injection</strong></a> like using bytecode instrumentation which some AOP (Aspect Oriented programming) framework like AspectJ does or by using proxies just like used in&#xA0;Spring.</p><p>You can further see the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fsolid-principles-object-oriented-design-architecture%2F"><strong>SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design and Architecture</strong></a> course on Udemy to learn more about this useful principle. It also represents &#x201C;D&#x201D; on the SOLID&#xA0;acronym.</p><p>Here is an example of the code which violates Dependency Inversion Principle or DIP in&#xA0;Java:</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fsolid-principles-object-oriented-design-architecture%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5MUhO6vdyh-HrZRXLzaYWw.jpeg"></a></figure><p>You can see that AppManager depends upon EventLogWriter which is tightly coupled with the AppManager. If you need to use another way to notify your client like by sending push notifications, SMS, or E-mail, you need to change the AppManager class.</p><p>This problem can be solved by using the Dependency Inversion Principle where instead of AppManager asking for EventLogWriter, it will be injected or provided to AppManager by the framework.</p><p>You can further see <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2F1-hour-crash-course-using-solid-to-write-better-code%2F">Using SOLID Principles to Write Better Code&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;A Crash Course</a> on Udemy to learn more about the Dependency Inversion Principle and how to solve such problems.</p><h3>6. Favor Composition over Inheritance</h3><p>There are two general ways to reuse the code you have already written, Inheritance and Composition, both have their own advantage and disadvantages, but, in general, you should always favor composition over inheritance, if possible.</p><blockquote>Some of you may argue this, but I found that <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/02/ifference-between-association-vs-composition-vs-aggregation.html#axzz5bnktTXS4">Composition </a>is the lot more flexible than <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2012/10/what-is-inheritance-in-java-and-oops-programming.html">Inheritance</a>.</blockquote><p>Composition allows changing the behavior of a class at run-time by setting property during run-time and by using Interfaces to compose a class we use <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/08/what-is-polymorphism-in-java-example.html">polymorphism</a> which provides flexibility to replace with better implementation any&#xA0;time.</p><p>Even Joshua Bloch&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Effective Java</strong></a> advise favoring composition over inheritance.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h3><p>According to the Liskov Substitution Principle, Subtypes must be substitutable for supertype I mean methods or functions which uses superclass type must be able to work with the <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-is-object-in-java-or-oops-example.html">object </a>of subclass without any issue&#x201D;.<br> <br>LSP is closely related <strong>to the Single responsibility principle</strong> and <strong>Interface Segregation Principle</strong>.</p><blockquote>If a class has more functionality than subclass might not support some of the functionality and does violate&#xA0;LSP.</blockquote><p>In order to follow <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fsolid-principles-object-oriented-design-architecture%2F">LSP SOLID design principle</a>, derived class or subclass must enhance functionality, but not reduce them. LSP represents &#x201C;L&#x201D; on the SOLID&#xA0;acronym.</p><p>Here is a code example which violates the Liskov Substitution Principle in&#xA0;Java:</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fsolid-principles-object-oriented-design-architecture%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gd-makNIG_0XdHvxLiaUFg.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Liskov Substitution Principle in&#xA0;Java</figcaption></figure><p>If you have a method area(Rectangle r) which calculates the area of Rectangle then that code will break when you pass the Square because Square is not really a Rectangle.</p><p>If you are interested in a more real-world example, then the <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fprinciples-oo-design"><strong>SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design</strong></a> course on Pluarlsight is a good course to start&#xA0;with.</p><p>Btw, you would need a Pluralsight membership to get access this course, which cost around $29 per month or $299 annually (14% discount).

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h3><p>Interface Segregation Principle stats that, a client should not implement an <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/04/10-points-on-interface-in-java-with.html">interface</a> if it doesn&#x2019;t use&#xA0;that.</p><p>This happens mostly when one interface contains more than one functionality, and the client only needs one functionality and no other.<br> <br>There is no doubt that Interface design is a tricky job because once you release your interface you can not change it without breaking all implementation. Well, Java 8&#x2019;s <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/07/default-defender-or-extension-method-of-Java8-example-tutorial.html#axzz5kO8vmDxy">default or defender method</a> feature does provide a way for interface evolution but not all Programming language support that features.</p><blockquote>Another benefit of this design principle in Java is, the interface has the disadvantage of implementing all method before any class can use it so having single functionality means less method to implement.</blockquote><p>If you don&#x2019;t the get the benefit of the interface in coding then I suggest you read my blog post, the <a href="http://www.java67.com/2014/02/what-is-actual-use-of-interface-in-java.html">real usage of an interface in Java</a> to learn&#xA0;more.</p><figure><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*kALM7NtYyY7D40b4.jpg"></figure><h3>9. Programming for Interface not implementation</h3><p>A programmer should always <em>program for the interface and not for implementation</em> this will lead to flexible code which can work with any new implementation of the interface.<br> <br>In concrete words, you should use interface type on variables, return types of a method or argument type of methods in Java like using SuperClass type to store object rather using SubClass.</p><p>I mean</p><p>List numbers= getNumbers();</p><p>instead of</p><p>ArrayList numbers = getNumbers();<br> <br>This has also been advised in many Java books including in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Effective Java</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596007124/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Head First design pattern</strong></a>&#xA0;book.</p><p>Here is an example of Coding for the interface in&#xA0;Java:</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Frefactoring-to-patterns%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G7G9QOZgc38o7Bzh9-TCBw.png"></a></figure><p>If you are interested in improving code quality of your program, I also suggest you take a look at the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Frefactoring-to-patterns%2F"><strong>Refactoring to Design Patterns</strong></a> course on Udemy which will help you to improve the internal design with refactoring techniques and design patterns in&#xA0;C#</p><h3>10. Delegation principles</h3><p>Don&#x2019;t do all stuff by yourself, delegate it to the respective class. Classical example of delegation design principle is <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-write-equals-method-in-java.html">equals() and hashCode() method in&#xA0;Java</a>.</p><blockquote>In order to compare two objects for equality, we ask the class itself to do comparison instead of Client class doing that&#xA0;check.</blockquote><p>The key benefit of this design principle is <strong>no duplication of code</strong> and pretty easy to modify behavior. Event delegation is another example of this principle, where an event is delegated to handlers for handling.</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/5-free-object-oriented-programming-online-courses-for-programmers-156afd0a3a73"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*Yz2uSaYOOI9AsnVK.jpg"></a></figure><h3>Summary</h3><p>All these <strong>object-oriented design principles </strong>help you write flexible and better code by striving high cohesion and low coupling.</p><p>The theory is the first step, but what is most important is to <em>develop the ability to find out when to apply these design principles</em>.<br> <br>Once you get hold of that, the next step is to learn Design patterns in Java, which uses these design patterns to solve common problems of application development and software engineering.</p><p>If you are looking for a nice course to start with, I suggest you join the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ffrom-0-to-1-design-patterns%2F"><strong>From 0 to 1: Design Patterns&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;24 That Matter&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;In Java</strong></a><strong> </strong>course on Udemy.

Java Development Kit follows many design principles like <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/12/factory-design-pattern-java-example.html#axzz51cvxH5kW">Factory Pattern</a> in BorderFactory class, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/05/double-checked-locking-on-singleton-in-java.html">Singleton pattern</a> in java.lang.Runtime class, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2013/07/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-real-life-example-tutorial.html">Decorator pattern</a> on various java.io classes.<br> <br>If you are interested in learning object-oriented principles and patterns, then you can look at my another personal favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596008678/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design</strong></a>, an excellent book and probably the best material available in object-oriented analysis and&#xA0;design</p><figure><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596008678/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/226/0*zcxGVki78MV8h3eE.jpg"></a></figure><p>Not many programmers know this book because it is often shadowed by its more popular cousin <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/?tag=javamysqlanta-20">Head First Design Pattern</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/96a4ff006e35">Eric Freeman</a>, which is more about how these principles come together to create a pattern you can use directly to solve known problems.</p><figure><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/224/0*50n3hCCWqlc8gkiF"></figure><p>These books help a lot to write better code, taking full advantage of various Object-oriented and SOLID design principles.
