<p>Web scraping is the process of extracting information and data from a website, transforming the information on a webpage into structured data for further analysis. Web scraping is also known as web harvesting or web data extraction. With the overwhelming data available on the internet, web scraping has become the essential approach to aggregating Big Data&#xA0;sets.</p><p>So, <strong>why should you learn web scraping and who is doing web scraping out there? </strong>We are going to address this question by looking into the different industries and jobs requiring web scraping skills. To do this, we&#x2019;ve compiled and analyzed the data extracted from job sites, including <a href="https://www.octoparse.com/tutorial-7/scrape-job-information-from-indeed"><em>Indeed</em></a>, <a href="https://www.octoparse.com/tutorial/web-scraping-case-study-scraping-job-postings-from-glassdoorcom"><em>Glassdoor</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=Web%20Scraping&amp;location=United%20States&amp;locationId=us%3A0"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p><p>At last, we also explored web scraping <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs">jobs in Google and Youtube</a>, to find out how many jobs requiring web scraping skills and what are the other requirements besides web scraping.</p><p>Followings are our findings to share with you.
