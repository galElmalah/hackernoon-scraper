<p>How to quickly start coding your next npm&#xA0;package</p><p>I was tired of typing same stuff over and over, to maybe just see if something was possible or not; so meanwhile I was trying to have an idea for another package, I&#x2019;ve created a package that makes a package&#x2026;quickly</p><p>It&#x2019;s called <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGabriele/create-npm-package"><strong>create-npm-package</strong></a></p><figure><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*7ol6GSroR7wwprR8ljJpBA.gif"></figure><p>It checks for you if the package name is available, it grabs your global git information so it can fill in your data in the package.json file, it drops a scaffold with some webpack configurations and few devDependencies and it also initialize a git repository: that&#x2019;s&#xA0;it!</p><p>I still don&#x2019;t know how much I can evolve this package, since I would like it to be pretty generic, but we&#x2019;ll&#xA0;see.</p><p>Please drop some ideas or questions on my Github repo <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGabriele/create-npm-package/issues">here</a> and I hope you will find it useful: at least I&#xA0;do!</p>                <div class="archive-tags">                                        <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/javascript">Javascript</a>                                        <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/coding">Coding</a>                                        <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/npm">Npm</a>                                        <a class="tag" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/package">Package</a>                  </div>                <div class="twitter-discussion">          <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhackernoon.com%2Fa-package-that-creates-a-package-979d3c448363">Continue the discussion <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a>        </div>
