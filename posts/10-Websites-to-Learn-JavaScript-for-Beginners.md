<h3>10 Websites to Learn JavaScript in&#xA0;Depth</h3><figure><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TAeuz2dPCa4HZX3h"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pinjasaur?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Paul Esch-Laurent</a> on&#xA0;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Hello All, We are fortunate to live in a world of technology where you have access to a lot of resources to learn whatever we want, all thanks to the Internet. You can literally learn whatever you want and that too without spending too much money like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/21-websites-to-learn-programming-for-free-5101c1ddf0c">Coding</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap.html">Web Development</a>, Mobile Development, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online-48424533ac61">Database</a>, Cloud Computing, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-data-structure-algorithms-and-programming-courses-to-crack-any-coding-interview-e1c50b30b927">Machine Learning</a>, or whatever you&#xA0;want.</p><p>But, if you are interested in the beautiful world of Web Development and If you want to learn <a href="http://java67.blogspot.com/2015/10/top-5-free-javascript-books-download-pdf-read-online.html">JavaScript</a> there are plenty of websites where you can <strong>learn JavaScript online for&#xA0;FREE</strong>.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t need to pay any fees, but you must have a good internet connection to take full advantage of these online resources.</p><p>Out of so many websites which offer free tutorials, articles, blog post, videos, and podcasts, I have chosen these 10 websites to recommend to anyone who wants to learn JavaScript. I am primarily a <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/10-tips-to-become-better-java-developer.html">Java developer</a>, but I have also learned <a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/12/10-programming-languages-to-learn-in.html">JavaScript</a> by following these websites.</p><p>If you are thinking why do I need to learn JavaScript? because I usually have to work on Java based web application which uses <a href="http://java67.blogspot.com/2012/10/servlet-jsp-interview-questions-answer-faq-experience.html">Servlet and JSP</a> for server-side scripting, but we always use <a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/12/10-programming-languages-to-learn-in.html">JavaScript </a>and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-jquery-courses-for-web-developers.html">jQuery </a>for client-side scripting.<br> <br>I would be first to admit that my JavaScript skills are not as good as Java and that&#x2019;s why I am always in search of some good resource to keep learn and refresh whatever I have learned online on JavaScript by following video tutorials and these interactive websites.</p><h3>10 Great Websites to learn JavaScript Online</h3><p>Here is my curated list of six websites to learn JavaScript online for FREE. It includes interactive websites, official resource, good books, and other resources.</p><h3><strong>1. Codecademy</strong></h3><p>In one word, this is a good website to learn many technologies online but probably the best website to learn JavaScript online.</p><p>Even though currently CodeAcademy offers <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html">Java</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-courses-to-learn-git-and-github-best-of-lot-2f394c6533b0">Git</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-linux-courses-for-programmers-4a433b4edade">UNIX command line</a> and several other courses, it made its name by an interactive JavaScript course to learn online at your own&#xA0;pace.</p><p>You can gauge the popularity of this course by looking at the number of students enrolled, currently <strong>5M+</strong>, which is the very high number for any online FREE&#xA0;course.</p><figure><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*fvtZcIA4a5Y8yXew.png"></a></figure><p>In short, Code Academy is one of the best websites to learn JavaScript online and you should take advantage of&#xA0;this.</p><h3>2. Udemy</h3><p>One of the best place for online learning. you will get online courses in all the latest technology and programming language like <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/these-are-the-best-free-courses-to-help-you-learn-java-8-and-java-9-a7615c8644ab">Java</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/12/top-5-spring-and-hibernate-training-courses-java-jee-programmers.html">Spring</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2019/02/top-10-free-algorithms-and-data.html">Data Structure and Algorithms</a>, Selenium, REST, etc. It provides both free and paid resources.</p><p>Here is a couple of useful free course to learn some of the interesting technologies:</p><ol><li><strong>The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects! (</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-complete-javascript-course%2F"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li><li><strong>The Web Developer Bootcamp&#xA0;(</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-web-developer-bootcamp%2F"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li><li><strong>JavaScript Bootcamp&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Build Real World Applications (</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-ultimate-javascript-course-build-real-world-apps2018%2F"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li><li><strong>Javascript Essentials (FREE)(</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjavascript-essentials%2F"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li></ol><p>The paid resources are also very cheap and you can purchase on just $9.99 during their flash sale, which happens quite often. It&#x2019;s full of some of the great teachers like <a href="https://medium.com/u/b74a1e474498">Colt_Steele</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/479f328b80ac">Rob Percival</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/d058882d8cd2">Stephen Grider</a>, Josh Portilla, <a href="https://medium.com/u/853b71b1de2">John Purcell</a>,&#xA0;etc.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;offerid=323058.9409&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Rv14Zh4TLwSAbB1c1DV_Rw.png"></a></figure><h3>3. Coursera</h3><p>This is another awesome website to learn online. It&#x2019; founded by Stanford professors <a href="https://medium.com/u/592ce2a67248">Andrew Ng</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/e9ca5cf8ba3a">Daphne Koller</a> and it offers courses, specializations, and online&#xA0;degrees.</p><p>The best part of <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2F">Coursera </a>is that it offers online courses from Universities like Stanford, University of London, University of Michigan, Colorado, Imperial College of London and many&#xA0;more.</p><p>It provides both free and paid online courses and specialization. Some of my favorite free programming courses from <a href="https://medium.com/u/99c0fb464c1f">Coursera</a> are&#xA0;:</p><ol><li><strong>Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS&#xA0;(</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fduke-programming-web"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li><li><strong>HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers (</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fhtml-css-javascript-for-web-developers"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li><li><strong>Interactivity with JavaScript (</strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fjavascript"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li></ol><p>Coursera also provides you Certification, which you can showcase in your Linkedin profile, but you need to pay for&#xA0;it.</p><figure><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2F"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*8OZmyjJTDhEx8WTYk6IoOA.png"></a></figure><h3>4. Pluralsight</h3><p>One of the best website to learn any technology, skills like Web Development, Mobile Development and Programming language like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html">Java</a>, Web development framework like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-10-angular-tutorials-and-courses-for-web-developers.html">Angular</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-2018-react-developer-roadmap.html">React</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-6-spring-framework-online-courses-Java-programmers.html">Spring Framework</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-hibernate-and-jpa-courses-for-java-programmers-learn-online.html">Hibernate</a>, etc.</p><p>The site also has a lot of useful courses to learn JavaScript from beginners perspective like&#xA0;:</p><ol><li><a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fjscript-fundamentals"><strong>JavaScript Fundamentals By Liam&#xA0;McLennan</strong></a></li><li><a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fjavascript-from-scratch"><strong>JavaScript From Scratch By Jesse&#xA0;Liberty</strong></a></li><li><a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fjavascript-programming-basics"><strong>Basics of Programming with JavaScript By Kyle&#xA0;Simpson</strong></a></li></ol><p>It&#x2019;s also now acquired CodeSchool which earlier allows you to learn web technologies by doing it. I use this website to learn a lot of cool stuff in no&#xA0;time.</p><figure><a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XV_3MRVV_Qy4xbnv0_23Mg.png"></a></figure><h3>5. <strong>freecodecamp.org</strong></h3><p>This is one of the most awesome community websites which will help you to learn to code for free, build real-world projects and get a job as a developer.</p><p>It has a massive collection of interactive tutorials and exercises to learn <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-data-structure-algorithms-and-programming-courses-to-crack-any-coding-interview-e1c50b30b927">Data Structure</a> and <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/these-are-the-best-free-courses-to-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-depth-4d52f0d6b35a">Algorithms</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e">Frontend Development</a> and so&#xA0;on.</p><p>Founded by <a href="https://medium.com/u/17756313f41a">Quincy Larson</a>, this is a really awesome place to start your coding journey. They even have a big Facebook group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/freeCodeCampEarth/">freecodecampearth</a>) where you can ask questions and share your learning experience and their <a href="https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6">Medium</a> publication <a href="https://medium.com/u/8b318225c16a">freeCodeCamp</a> is the biggest Medium publication for Programming articles.</p><figure><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/1*dj_JFPtEe7wdGR3DlkXG_Q.png"></a></figure><h3><strong>6. Code&#xA0;Combat</strong></h3><p>JavaScript can be a fairly easy way to add added functionality to your web page, but learning <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/02/top-5-javascript-books-to-learn-best-of-lot-must-read.html">JavaScript</a> on your own can be a daunting task. CodeCombat is a platform for students to learn computer science while playing through a real&#xA0;game.</p><p>Courses have been specifically playtested to excel in the classroom, even by teachers with little to no prior programming experience. It has some <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/02/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-web-development.html">web development courses</a> to learn the basics of JavaScript.</p><figure><a href="http://codecombat.com/"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*wPW19yAVNr7Mwrvg.png"></a></figure><p>In short, a website more suitable for beginners and students. You can learn the basics of JavaScript fairly quickly by following their unique&#xA0;style.</p><h3><strong>7. Code&#xA0;School</strong></h3><p>This one is another website which I really love. Their jQuery tutorial is really great, but JavaScript course is also not far behind and gives you real chance to learn JavaScript online for FREE at your own&#xA0;pace.</p><p>Similar to Codecademy, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a> also offers interactive tutorial but it&#x2019;s more fun as you get marks, badges and cross&#xA0;levels.</p><figure><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*jc4AdlrNXDrq3j3p.png"></a></figure><p>This is once again one of the best resources to learn JavaScript online. It&#x2019;s interactive, interesting and at the same time non-trivial.</p><h3><strong>8. Learning the Web&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Mozilla Developer Network</strong></h3><p>Mozilla is for the serious learner, a programmer who loves to do their own stuff and just want to read the theory and try examples in their own&#xA0;setup.</p><p>Unlike CodeAcademy and CodeSchool, this is not interactive but you will find detailed information. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla </a>is also the official source for any <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/03/10-difference-between-java-and-javascript-programming.html">JavaScript </a>information.</p><figure><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*OPy_RZz2Lq1dJqOc.png"></a></figure><p>I use this site as reference documentation for many JavaScript, it contains a wealth of information and you can do the same&#xA0;too.</p><h3>10. Learn JavaScript Online&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;CodeMentor</h3><p>Another great site which provides interactive JavaScript tutorial. This website provides a 4-week course to learn JavaScript, in fact, to master JavaScript, as the course claims. You will not only learn about core JavaScript but also about other famous JavaScript library and related concepts like ajax, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/02/how-to-consume-json-from-restful-web-services-Spring-RESTTemplate-Example.html">json</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-jquery-courses-for-web-developers-best-of-lot-9f65a1ff25b6">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-10-angular-courses-tutorials-and-books-for-web-developers-e8a8e2c490c2">angular js</a> and&#xA0;more.</p><figure><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*9vqRprv60wtIpGvL.png"></figure><p>That&#x2019;s all about these <strong>best websites to learn JavaScript online</strong>. If you are serious about learning JavaScript then you must not just sit back and relax but also start developing some real-world project, start using popular JavaScript library like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-jquery-courses-for-web-developers.html">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/5-best-courses-to-learn-angular.html">Angular</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-2018-react-developer-roadmap.html">React</a>, and <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html">Node JS</a> to become proficient on what industry is expecting from a JavaScript Developer.</p><p>If you like to read book more than websites, then you also start with reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Head First JavaScript</strong></a>, one of the best books to learn JavaScript from&#xA0;scratch.</p><figure><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><img alt src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*I62JoZK9s6dcH-hP-bPOSw.jpeg"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X?tag=javamysqlanta-20"><strong>Head First JavaScript</strong></a>,</figcaption></figure><p>If you think there is another Website which is a great resource to learn JavaScript online and for FREE then please suggest it on the comments section, I would be happy to include that on this&#xA0;list.</p><p>More <strong>Online Resources</strong> for learning JavaScript and&#xA0;jQuery</p><ul><li>The 2019 Web Developer RoadMap (<a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e">roadmap</a>)</li><li>The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Object-Oriented-JavaScript-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1593275404?tag=javamysqlanta-20">book</a>)</li><li>5 Books to Learn and Master JavaScript (<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/02/top-5-javascript-books-to-learn-best-of-lot-must-read.html">books</a>)</li><li>5 jQuery books for JavaScript Developers (<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/07/top-5-jquery-books-for-web-developers-learn.html">books</a>)</li><li>2 Websites to learn Coding online for FREE (<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/06/2-websites-to-learn-coding-in-java-online-free.html">see&#xA0;here</a>)</li><li>5 Great websites to learn SQL for FREE (<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/06/5-websites-to-learn-sql-online-for-free.html">see&#xA0;here</a>)</li><li>5 Free JavaScript book and PDF (<a href="http://www.java67.com/2015/10/top-5-free-javascript-books-download-pdf-read-online.html">download</a>)</li><li>10 Courses to Learn JavaScript Better (<a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-10-courses-to-learn-javascript-in.html#axzz5mvsv6B1j">courses</a>)</li></ul><p>Thank you for reading this far, if you have any questions or feedback then please drop a comment.
