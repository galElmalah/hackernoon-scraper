Wealthy kids are able to learn even during summer, growing in a stimulating environment, having many books to read, being able to travel, attending summer camps, discovering new things and having proficient conversation with adults.</div><div class="paragraph">Poor kids, on other hands, spent their summer watching TV and playing with other kids in the neighbourhood. They have an all summer long break from learning.</div><div class="paragraph">And once back in school, the gap starts to widen. It&#x2019;s the so called &#x201C;Achievement Gap&#x201D; (you can read an extract of this chapter&#xA0;<a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=qQc7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT164&amp;lpg=PT164&amp;dq=the+outliers+advantage+of+rich+kid+poor+kid+in+school&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8g2gckWcco&amp;sig=NMBVXk4GNuR3Dl_zlVs03rsgqSs&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC2uTu2-XVAhUJL1AKHVjHD1AQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20outliers%20advantage%20of%20rich%20kid%20poor%20kid%20in%20school&amp;f=false">here</a>).</div><div class="paragraph">But does this work just for childern in primary school? Or could be true also for adults? May be the case we are more focused on making holidays plan and chilling than to learn new things?</div><div class="paragraph">Avoiding any doubts, I decided to challenge myself, setting the goal to learn a coding language from scratches during summer.</div><h2><strong>2. WHERE TO START:</strong></h2><div class="paragraph">My coding skills are basically null. I did some lame experiences with VBA and Matlab when I was like&#x2026;25 (damn, I&#x2019;m getting old geez!), so I have to set a challenging but also doable goal.</div><div class="paragraph">If you&#x2019;re proficient in coding, please forgive me in advance; I&#x2019;m using terms such as &#x201C;learning&#x201D;, &#x201C;understanding&#x201D;, &#x201C;competence&#x201D;, and I&#x2019;ll surely look naive to someone that spent years properly learning the language. Fair enough!</div><blockquote><div class="paragraph">The best time to learn to code was ten years ago.

WHY PYTHON:</strong></h2><div class="paragraph"><strong>&#x201C;</strong>Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries. Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps&#x201D; (<a href="http://www.bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/why-learn-python">Why Learn Python</a>).</div><div class="paragraph">Python is elegant, readable, and easy to understand at first, especially for someone like me that has no solid background in coding.</div><div class="paragraph">Suppose you&#x2019;re willing to print &#x201C;<a href="https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYt4ym7eXVAhXHY1AKHcwFD1kQFgg7MAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%2522Hello%2C_World!%2522_program&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfl-sRw62JgahA16FJaZSX9L7oCg">Hello World</a>&#x201D; to your console:</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>C++:</strong></div><div class="code-container"><pre style="display:block;overflow-x:auto;background:black;color:#eaeaea;padding:30px"><code><span class="hljs-function"><span style="color:#c397d8">int</span> <span style="color:#7aa6da">main</span><span style="color:#e78c45">()</span></span>{<span style="color:#e78c45">cout</span>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#b9ca4a">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span>;<span style="color:#c397d8">return</span> <span style="color:#e78c45">0</span>;}</code></pre></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Python:</strong></div><div class="code-container"><pre style="display:block;overflow-x:auto;background:black;color:#eaeaea;padding:30px"><code><span style="color:#c397d8">print</span> (<span style="color:#b9ca4a">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div><div class="paragraph">Persuasive enough, uhm?</div><div class="paragraph">Plus, it has tons of application, and should be relative easy to automate also everyday tasks at work or at home.</div><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/eb796xTMq6TB75NaGzdtTD30l7G2-px23zy7" alt></div><div class="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/"><em>https://automatetheboringstuff.com/</em></a><em></em></div><div class="paragraph">Being completely open source, there are just tons of useful resources, tutorials, manuals you can get your hands on for free and learn from.</div><div class="paragraph">Do you know that the name &#x201C;Python&#x201D; is coming from &#x201C;Monthy Python&#x201D; and that the language was invented &#x201C;for fun&#x201D; by Guido van Rossum during Christmas Holiday?</div><blockquote><div class="paragraph">&#x201C;Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a &#x201C;hobby&#x201D; programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office &#x2026; would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python&#x2019;s Flying Circus).&#x201D;</div></blockquote><div class="paragraph">In 1999, van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to&#xA0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA">DARPA</a>&#xA0;called&#xA0;<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.123.6836&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><em>Computer Programming for Everybody</em></a>, in which he further defined his goals for Python:</div><ul><li>An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open source</a>, so anyone can contribute to its development</li><li>Code that is as understandable as plain English</li><li>Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times<br><br></li></ul><h2><strong>4. GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY:</strong></h2><div class="paragraph">I am working full time, so I needed to schedule my learning mostly after works in the evening, or at best during weekends. I wanted a practical and effective approach, at the same time preparing to commit to an hard task (learning to code basically means learning to solve problems in a finite environment).</div><div class="paragraph">First thing first, I needed to understand the basics. My usual approach is to get a bit of theory first, so I headed to the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide?source=post_page-----a5aeadfc7e50----------------------">Python Wiki</a> and read as much as I can, trying to comprehend as more as possible and getting the basic dictionary of the language.</div><div class="paragraph">I was also lucky enough to have some friend supporting me along the journey:</div><div class="paragraph"><a href="http://www.dima.unige.it/~perasso/">Annalisa</a>&#xA0;gave me an invaluable hint, suggesting to install the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj915ml8-XVAhXGh7QKHepTBkQQFggnMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.continuum.io%2Fdownloads&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5KKA7CTASoQKpNBeQAV2xSKKTrQ">Anaconda Distribution</a>, together with some advice on how to smooth my dirty raw code! While Davide gave me&#xA0;<a href="http://www.apogeonline.com/libri/9788850334148/scheda">this book</a>, that was indeed usuful to understand the basic of data analysis.</div><div class="paragraph">After this quick introduction to the language, was time to get my hands on code. Among the dozen of tutorials and courses, I started from the one proposed by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/search?query=python">Codecademy</a>:</div><div class="paragraph">I found the course incredible effective: first of all their IDLE (<em>&#xA0;Integrated Development Learning Environment</em>) is smart and readable. It really helps breaking the ice. Consider that the course is on version 2.7, and it&#x2019;s 100% free of charge.</div><div class="paragraph">Exercises are easy, tailored for beginner for sure, but not stupid or obvious. You have to think and try many solutions before getting the green light from the computer (only one solution is accepted for each exercise, even if many could be theoretically possible). It also include a forum where you can post your question and in ALMOST REAL TIME receive feedback from the community. The people volunteering here are great: they never offer you the solution, but they gave you hints and suggestions, forcing you to think again and finally solve the problem on your own.</div><h2>5. CREATING YOUR OWN WORK ENVIRONMENT:</h2><div class="paragraph">After finishing the online course, I feel &#x201C;competent&#x201D; enough to install Python on my machine (I&#x2019;m running on Windows) and try to develop some projects on my own.</div><div class="paragraph">Firstly I tried the raw Python install. But I don&#x2019;t like the work environment.</div><div class="paragraph">After this unsuccessful trial, I proceeded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)">Anaconda Distribution</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">Anaconda is a freemium, open source, distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It comes with Spyder, an incredible effective and easy to use IDE. I liked it immediately:</div><div class="image-container"><img src="https://hackernoon.com/photos/eb796xTMq6TB75NaGzdtTD30l7G2-die33zcx" alt></div><div class="paragraph"><em>My work environment on Spyder: so clean and simple &#x2764;&#x2764;&#x2764;</em></div><div class="paragraph">Aside that, I wanted to have also an online repository for my codes. I picked the most basic yet likeable solution possible: <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl</a></div><div class="paragraph">Repl is a simple online IDE, not just for Python but for many languages such as JavaScript, C++, Ruby, HTML, and more.</div><div class="paragraph">I like it since it easily allows me to write, check and share code from any pc and mobile. I&#x2019;m using it also as online repository for my projects. It&#x2019;s effective and easy. I like it a lot!</div><h2>6. WHAT I LEARNED:</h2><div class="paragraph"><strong>0.</strong> Surely I haven&#x2019;t learned &#x201C;how to code&#x201D;. That would have been a whole different learning process, I won&#x2019;t claim this. But it was a very profitable exercise anyway! I also grown interest in Python and in programming languages in general and I&#x2019;ll likely invest more time in the future to learn about it.</div><blockquote><strong>1.</strong>Firstly, I learned to read programming languages a bit.</blockquote><div class="paragraph">While first, looking at a complex code, I would immediately discharge it, thinking &#x201C;there&#x2019;s no way I can understand what&#x2019;s going on here&#x201D;, now I&#x2019;m thinking &#x201C;ok, let&#x2019;s see if I&#x2019;m able to get something out of this mess&#x201D;.</div><div class="paragraph">It&#x2019;s a bit tricky to explain this, but it&#x2019;s like I gave myself the &#x201C;permission&#x201D; to try to read and understand code. I am at least able to break a complex script or algorithm in little chunks I can understand, or at least search for their meaning on&#xA0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>&#xA0;or&#xA0;<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</div><div class="paragraph">This is probably the most valuable lesson I get from the whole project.</div><blockquote><strong>2.</strong> Learning to code is hard, so, implicitly, I strengthen my problem solving attitude (even better: &#x201C;<em>the code is easy, it&#x2019;s solving the problem that is hard&#x201D;</em>). </blockquote><div class="paragraph">It&#x2019;s a mindset: there&#x2019;s this problem, and you have to rely on your expertise only to solve it.</div><div class="paragraph">Last week, my gf needed help to fix an issue with an HTML string on&#xA0;<a href="http://www.cucinaconsapevole.it/">her website</a>. Usually, I would have searched for a solution straight on Google. But this time, I patiently read thru the lines until I found a little &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D; missing. Fixed and solved. It was like Xmas to me that day :)</div><blockquote><div class="paragraph">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m so smart, it&#x2019;s just that I stay with problems longer.&#x201D;</div><div class="paragraph">Albert Einstein</div></blockquote><blockquote><strong>3.</strong> Then, I was able to develop some little project on my own. </blockquote><div class="paragraph">The classic exercises for beginner, but very interesting nevertheless (click on the link to see and try the code on my Repl repository):</div><ul><li><a href="https://repl.it/KBfi/5">Hangman Game</a><a href="https://repl.it/JsjT/1"></a></li><li><a href="https://repl.it/JsjT/1">Word guesser</a></li><li>Also a lame&#xA0;<a href="https://repl.it/JjMW/4">Battleship</a>&#xA0;game</li></ul><div class="paragraph"><strong>4.</strong> I spent also some nights on Pygame! <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about">Pygame</a> is a free and open source Python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games built on top of the excellent&#xA0;<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>&#xA0;library.</div><div class="paragraph">In a week I was able to write my PONG! code&#x2026;hell yeah!
