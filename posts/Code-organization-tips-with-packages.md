<p><em>How to organize Go code with packages?</em></p><figure><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*78MS26SyHeUt5oDCQnIIpw.png"><figcaption>Imagine a package like above: It packages like-minded source codes together.</figcaption></figure><p>For small programs, you probably don&#x2019;t need to define another package other than the special package: main. For bigger programs, you might need to define your own packages to organize your code. For people who work on the same code to create many programs, they may need to define their own libraries and import these to their own programs.</p><p>In my own projects, I create a <em>cmd </em>folder to keep entry-point applications of my program, then I do dependency-injection and other orchestration code there. All of the other code lives inside internal folders and not get reused by the outer packages other than the ones in my&#xA0;program.</p><p><strong>Splitting packages into sub-directories</strong></p><figure><img alt src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*0oSX5ph2IlZv0bVcVS-XWg.png"></figure><p>You can split packages into subdirectories, Go stdlib uses this style. Look at <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">http package</a> for example. It&#x2019;s inside <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/">net</a> package. Http things belong to network things, so, they put it under net package. However, that doesn&#x2019;t mean that, <em>http</em> package can use <em>net</em> package&#x2019;s internals, it cannot. <strong>Each go package is a different beast on its own</strong>, there&#x2019;s no relationship between <em>net</em> and <em>http</em> package in stdlib other than the organization purposes.</p><p><strong>Go provides no sub-packaging mechanism </strong>and when you split up your packages to organize your BIG package, you may make some of the internals of your package to the outside world, and so, anyone can import them. You may not want this, so, <em>internal package </em>convention prevents your packages to be imported from unwanted parties. <em>I explain internal packages </em><a href="https://medium.com/im-learning-go-golang/special-packages-and-directories-in-go-1d6295690a6b"><em>here in this&#xA0;post</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>And, last, new gophers who are beginning to Go, create, <em>src/ </em>folders, you don&#x2019;t need to do that. Just put your source files into your project root. It&#x2019;s better that&#xA0;way.</p><ul><li><strong>Names should be as simple as possible </strong>like: <em>http, zip, and time. </em>You and other people are going to use and recall them with this name. Keep them short, simple, concise and to the&#xA0;point.</li><li><strong>Do not use double or more words</strong> in names like: <em>net_http</em>. Do it like: <em>net/http</em>. Different packages, but because <em>http </em>package is inside <em>net </em>directory, if there was another package which named also as <em>http, </em>there will be no problem, because they live in separate directories.</li><li><strong>Let the package path speaks for what the packages does</strong>. <em>net/http</em>. It&#x2019;s clear, isn&#x2019;t? <em>http </em>package is a package that does things related somehow with networking. If it was inside <em>security/http </em>package it&#x2019;d imply different meanings.</li><li><strong>Use common abbrevations</strong> if it&#x2019;s familiar to the programmers (<em>or to the programmers in domain of the application you&#x2019;re building)</em>. For example: Instead of <em>formattedIO</em>, stdlib uses&#xA0;<em>fmt</em>.</li><li><strong>Definitely avoid ultra-generic package names</strong> like <em>api, models, common, utils, helper etc. </em>For example: Instead of a model package, define a package that does user things named as&#xA0;<em>user.</em></li><li><strong>Do not use underscores or camel-casing</strong>. Just use lowercase letters.</li><li><strong>Names can contain unicode characters</strong> (<em>however I don&#x2019;t recommend using&#xA0;this)</em></li></ul><p>More on this <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#package-names">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.golang.org/package-names">here</a>. And to better use packages, always read stdlib&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/">code</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>There is no package versioning in Go.</strong> go get always fetches from HEAD from a git repository. However, there are some workarounds. For example: You can save a package you want manually into your program, so that you can use whatever version you want. More tips&#xA0;<a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version">here</a>.</li><li>To get all of the dependencies for the current package you&#x2019;re working in by typing: go get&#xA0;./&#x2026;</li></ul><p>You made it here!
