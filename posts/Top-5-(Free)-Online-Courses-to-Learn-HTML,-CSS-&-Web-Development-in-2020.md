As a programmer or software developer, you should know how to create a website and how to create a mobile app of your&#xA0;own.</blockquote><p>Though it&#x2019;s not easy. Coding is like art and many people born with coding sense, I mean they love coding, they love to create stuff like websites, mobile apps, games, etc and they love to automate&#xA0;things.</p><p>They are a very good self-learner and almost learn anything by themselves, but don&#x2019;t get discouraged if you don&#x2019;t have those skills. By perseverance and hard work, you can also learn whatever you want. In the past, I have shared some <a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/12/10-ways-to-learn-new-technology-programming-language-or-framework.html">tips to learn new technology</a> and books and courses are an integral part of it.<br> <br>I personally like free courses to start learning a new technology e.g. when I had to learn <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/12/top-5-courses-to-learn-big-data-and.html">Apache Spark</a> recently, I started with online courses followed by book for more comprehensive learning.</p><blockquote>Online courses provide you a summary and essential details so that you can get a start without investing too much&#xA0;time.</blockquote><p>It is also more engaging and active way of learning. On the other hand, books are a little bit passive learning than courses and that&#x2019;s why you must have some background to grasp the technical details given in books.<br> <br>In this article, I am going to share some of the best, free online courses to learn <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-web-development.html#axzz5B6EWE6M7">Web Development</a> using HTML and CSS.
